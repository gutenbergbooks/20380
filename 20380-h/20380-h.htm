			<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix" name="pageix"></a>ix</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
			<p>The <i>conte</i> is a form of fiction in which the
			French have always delighted and in which
			they have always excelled, from the days of
			the <i>jongleurs</i> and the <i>trouvères</i>, past the periods
			of La Fontaine and Voltaire, down to
			the present. The <i>conte</i> is a tale, something
			more than a sketch, it may be, and something
			less than a short story. In verse it is at times
			but a mere rhymed anecdote, or it may attain
			almost to the direct swiftness of a ballad.
			The <i>Canterbury Tales</i> are <i>contes</i>, most
			of them, if not all; and so are some of the
			<i>Tales of a Wayside Inn</i>. The free-and-easy
			tales of Prior were written in imitation
			of the French <i>conte en vers</i>; and that,
			likewise, was the model of more than one of
			the lively narrative poems of Mr. Austin
			Dobson.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagex" name="pagex"></a>x</span>No one has succeeded more abundantly
			in the <i>conte en vers</i> than M. Coppée. Where
			was there ever anything better of its kind
			than <i>L&#8217;Enfant de la Balle?</i>&#8212;that gentle
			portrait of the Infant Phenomenon, framed
			in a chain of occasional gibes at the sordid
			ways of theatrical managers and at their hostility
			towards poetic plays. Where is there
			anything of a more simple pathos than
			<i>L&#8217;Épave?</i>&#8212;that story of a sailor&#8217;s son
			whom the widowed mother strives vainly to
			keep from the cruel waves that killed his
			father. (It is worthy of a parenthesis that
			although the ship M. Coppée loves best is
			that which sails the blue shield of the City
			of Paris, he knows the sea also, and he depicts
			sailors with affectionate fidelity.) But
			whether at the sea-side by chance, or more
			often in the streets of the city, the poet seeks
			out for the subject of his story some incident
			of daily occurrence made significant by his
			interpretation; he chooses some character
			common-place enough, but made firmer by
			conflict with evil and by victory over self.
			Those whom he puts into his poems are still
			the humble, the forgotten, the neglected, the
			unknown; and it is the feelings and the
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexi" name="pagexi"></a>xi</span>struggles of these that he tells us, with no
			maudlin sentimentality, and with no dead
			set at our sensibilities. The sub-title Mrs.
			Stowe gave to <i>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</i> would
			serve to cover most of M. Coppée&#8217;s <i>contes</i>
			either in prose or verse; they are nearly
			all pictures of <em>life among the lowly</em>. But
			there is no forcing of the note in his painting
			of poverty and labor; there is no harsh
			juxtaposition of the blacks and the whites.
			The tone is always manly and wholesome.</p>

			<p><i>La Marchande de Journaux</i> and the other
			little masterpieces of story-telling in verse
			are unfortunately untranslatable, as are all
			poems but a lyric or two, now and then,
			by a happy accident. A translated poem is
			a boiled strawberry, as some one once put it
			brutally. But the tales which M. Coppée
			has written in prose&#8212;a true poet&#8217;s prose,
			nervous, vigorous, flexible, and firm&#8212;these
			can be Englished by taking thought and
			time and pains, without which a translation
			is always a betrayal. Ten of these tales
			have been rendered into English by Mr.
			Learned; and the ten chosen for translation
			are among the best of the two score and
			more of M. Coppée&#8217;s <i>contes en prose</i>. These
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexii" name="pagexii"></a>xii</span>ten tales are fairly representative of his range
			and variety. Compare, for example, the passion
			in &#8220;The Foster Sister,&#8221; pure, burning
			and fatal, with the Black Forest <i>naïveté</i> of
			&#8220;The Sabots of Little Wolff.&#8221; Contrast the
			touching pathos of &#8220;The Substitute,&#8221; poignant
			in his magnificent self-sacrifice, by which
			the man who has conquered his shameful
			past goes back willingly to the horrible life
			he has fled from that he may save from a
			like degradation and from an inevitable moral
			decay the one friend he has in the world,
			all unworthy as this friend is&#8212;contrast
			this with the story of the gigantic deeds
			&#8220;My Friend Meurtrier&#8221; boasts about unceasingly,
			not knowing that he has been discovered
			in his little round of daily domestic
			duties, making the coffee of his good old
			mother and taking her poodle out for a walk.</p>

			<p>Among these ten there are tales of all
			sorts, from the tragic adventure of &#8220;An Accident&#8221;
			to the pendent portraits of the &#8220;Two
			Clowns,&#8221; cutting in its sarcasm, but not
			bitter&#8212;from &#8220;The Captain&#8217;s Vices,&#8221; which
			suggests at once George Eliot&#8217;s <i>Silas Marner</i>
			and Mr. Austin Dobson&#8217;s <i>Tale of Polypheme</i>,
			to the sombre revery of the poet &#8220;At
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexiii" name="pagexiii"></a>xiii</span>Table,&#8221; a sudden and searching light cast on
			the labor and misery which underlies the luxury
			of our complex modern existence. Like
			&#8220;At Table,&#8221; &#8220;A Dramatic Funeral&#8221; is a picture
			more than it is a story; it is a marvellous
			reproduction of the factitious emotion of the
			good-natured stage folk, who are prone to
			overact even their own griefs and joys. &#8220;A
			Dramatic Funeral&#8221; seems to me always as
			though it might be a painting of M. Jean
			Beraud, that most Parisian of artists, just as
			certain stories of M. Guy de Maupassant
			inevitably suggest the bold freedom of M.
			Forain&#8217;s sketches in black-and-white.</p>

			<p>An ardent admirer of the author of the stories
			in <i>The Odd Number</i> has protested to me
			that M. Coppée is not an etcher like M. de
			Maupassant, but rather a painter in water-colors.
			And why not? Thus might we call
			M. Alphonse Daudet an artist in pastels, so
			adroitly does he suggest the very bloom of
			color. No doubt M. Coppée&#8217;s <i>contes</i> have
			not the sharpness of M. de Maupassant&#8217;s,
			nor the brilliancy of M. Daudet&#8217;s&#8212;but what
			of it? They have qualities of their own; they
			have sympathy, poetry, and a power of suggesting
			pictures not exceeded, I think, by
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexiv" name="pagexiv"></a>xiv</span>those of either M. de Maupassant or M.
			Daudet. M. Coppée&#8217;s street views in Paris,
			his interiors, his impressionist sketches of
			life under the shadows of Notre Dame, are
			convincingly successful. They are intensely
			to be enjoyed by those of us who take the
			same keen delight in the varied phases of
			life in New York. They are not, to my mind,
			really rivalled either by those of M. de Maupassant,
			who is a Norman by birth and a
			nomad by choice, or by those of M. Daudet,
			who is a native of Provence, although now
			for thirty years a resident of Paris. M. Coppée
			is a Parisian from his youth up, and even
			in prose he is a poet; perhaps this is why
			his pictures of Paris are unsurpassable in
			their felicity and in their verity.</p>

			<p>It may be fancy, but I seem to see also a
			finer morality in M. Coppée&#8217;s work than in
			M. de Maupassant&#8217;s or in M. Daudet&#8217;s or in
			that of almost any other of the Parisian
			story-tellers of to-day. In his tales we
			breathe a purer moral atmosphere, more
			wholesome and more bracing. It is not
			that M. Coppée probably thinks of ethics
			rather than æsthetics; in this respect his attitude
			is undoubtedly that of the others;
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexv" name="pagexv"></a>xv</span>there is no sermon in his song&#8212;or at least
			none for those who will not seek it for themselves;
			there is never a hint of a preachment.
			But for all that I have found in his
			work a trace of the tonic morality which inheres
			in Molière, for example, also a Parisian
			by birth, and also in Rabelais, despite his
			disguising grossness. This finer morality
			comes possibly from a wider and a deeper
			survey of the universe; and it is as different
			as possible from the morality which is externally
			applied and which always punishes
			the villain in the fifth act.</p>

			<p>It is of good augury for our own letters
			that the best French fiction of to-day is getting
			itself translated in the United States,
			and that the liking for it is growing apace.
			Fiction is more consciously an art in France
			than anywhere else&#8212;perhaps partly because
			the French are now foremost in nearly all
			forms of artistic endeavor. In the short
			story especially, in the tale, in the <i>conte</i>, their
			supremacy is incontestable; and their skill
			is shown and their æsthetic instinct exemplified
			partly in the sense of form, in the
			constructive method, which underlies the
			best short stories, however trifling these may
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexvi" name="pagexvi"></a>xvi</span>appear to be, and partly in the rigorous suppression
			of non-essentials, due in a measure,
			it may be, to the example of Mérimee. That
			is an example we in America may study to
			advantage; and from the men who are writing
			fiction in France we may gain much.
			From the British fiction of this last quarter
			of the nineteenth century little can be learned
			by any one&#8212;less by us Americans in whom
			the English tradition is still dominant. When
			we look to France for an exemplar we may
			find a model of value, but when we copy an
			Englishman we are but echoing our own
			faults. &#8220;The truth is,&#8221; said Mr. Lowell in
			his memorable essay <i>On a Certain Condescension
			in Foreigners</i>&#8212;&#8220;the truth is that we
			are worth nothing except so far as we have
			disinfected ourselves of Anglicism.&#8221;</p>

		<h3>I.</h3>

		<p>It is of no importance,
		the name of the little provincial
		city where Captain
		Mercadier&#8212;twenty-six
		years of service, twenty-two
		campaigns, and three
		wounds&#8212;installed himself
		when
		he was retired
		on a
		pension.</p>

		<a  class="figleft" href="images/fig016.jpg"><img src="images/fig016c.jpg" alt="Two more geese, strolling in the grass across the bottom of the page." title="Click to see the whole illustration." /></a>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>4</span>It was quite like all those other little villages
		which solicit without obtaining it a
		branch of the railway; just as if it were not
		the sole dissipation of the natives to go every
		day, at the same hour, to the Place de
		la Fontaine to see the diligence come in at
		full gallop, with its gay cracking of the whips
		and clang of bells.</p>

		<p>It was a place of three thousand inhabitants&#8212;ambitiously
		denominated souls in the
		statistical tables&#8212;and was exceedingly proud
		of its title of chief city of the canton. It
		had ramparts planted with trees, a pretty
		river with good fishing, a church of the
		charming epoch of the flamboyant Gothic,
		disgraced by a frightful station of the cross,
		brought directly from the quarter of Saint
		Sulpice. Every Monday its market was gay
		with great red and blue umbrellas, and
		countrymen filled its streets in carts and
		carriages. But for the rest of the week it
		retired with delight into that silence and
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>5</span>solitude which made it so dear to its rustic
		population. Its streets were paved with
		cobble-stones; through the windows of the
		ground-floor one could see samplers and
		wax-flowers under glass domes, and, through
		the gates of the gardens, statuettes of Napoleon
		in shell-work. The principal inn was
		naturally called the Shield of France; and
		the town-clerk made rhymed acrostics for
		the ladies of society.</p>

		<p>Captain Mercadier had chosen that place
		of retreat for the simple reason that he had
		been born there, and because, in his noisy
		childhood, he had pulled down the signs and
		plugged up the bell-buttons. He returned
		there to find neither relations, nor friends,
		nor acquaintances; and the recollections of
		his youth recalled only the angry faces of
		shop-keepers who shook their fists at him
		from the shop-doors, a catechism which
		threatened him with hell, a school which
		predicted the scaffold, and, finally, his departure
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>6</span>for his regiment, hastened by a paternal
		malediction.</p>

		<p>For the Captain was not a saintly man;
		the old record of his punishment was black
		with days in the guard-house inflicted for
		breaches of discipline, absences from roll-calls,
		and nocturnal uproars in the mess-room.
		He had often narrowly escaped losing
		his stripes as a corporal or a sergeant,
		and he needed all the chance, all the license
		of a campaigning life to gain his first epaulet.
		Firm and brave soldier, he had passed
		almost all his life in Algiers at that time when
		our foot soldiers wore the high shako, white
		shoulder-belts and huge cartridge-boxes.
		He had had Lamoricière for commander.
		The Due de Nemours, near whom he received
		his first wound, had decorated him, and
		when he was sergeant-major, Père Bugrand
		had called him by his name and pulled his
		ears. He had been a prisoner of Abd-el-Kader,
		bearing the scar of a yataghan stroke
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>7</span>on his neck, of one ball in his shoulder and
		another in his chest; and notwithstanding
		absinthe, duels, debts of play, and almond-eyed
		Jewesses, he fairly won, with the point
		of the bayonet and sabre, his grade of captain
		in the First Regiment of Sharp-shooters.</p>

		<p>Captain Mercadier&#8212;twenty-six years of
		service, twenty-two campaigns, and three
		wounds&#8212;had just retired on his pension,
		not quite two thousand francs, which, joined
		to the two hundred and fifty francs from his
		cross, placed him in that estate of honorable
		penury which the State reserves for its old
		servants.</p>

		<p>His entry into his natal city was without
		ostentation. He arrived one morning on
		the imperiale of the diligence, chewing an
		extinguished cigar, and already on good
		terms with the conductor, to whom, during
		his journey, he had related the passage of
		the Porte de Fer; full of indulgence, moreover,
		for the distractions of his auditor, who
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>8</span>often interrupted the recital by some oath
		or epithet addressed to the off mare. When
		the diligence stopped he threw on the sidewalk
		his old valise, covered with railway
		placards as numerous as the changes of
		garrison that its proprietor had made, and
		the idlers of the neighborhood were astonished
		to see a man with a decoration&#8212;a
		rare thing in the province&#8212;offer a glass of
		wine to the coachman at the bar of an inn
		near by.</p>

		<p>He installed himself at once. In a house
		in the outskirts, where two captive cows
		lowed, and fowls and ducks passed and repassed
		through the gate-way, a furnished
		chamber was to let. Preceded by a masculine-looking
		woman, the Captain climbed
		the stair-way with its great wooden balusters,
		perfumed by a strong odor of the stable, and
		reached a great tiled room, whose walls were
		covered with a bizarre paper representing,
		printed in blue on a white background and
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>9</span>repeated infinitely, the picture of Joseph Poniatowski
		crossing the Elster on his horse.
		This monotonous decoration, recalling nevertheless
		our military glories, fascinated the
		Captain without doubt, for, without concerning
		himself with the uncomfortable straw
		chairs, the walnut furniture, or the little bed
		with its yellowed curtain, he took the room
		without hesitation. A quarter of an hour
		was enough to empty his trunk, hang up his
		clothes, put his boots in a corner, and ornament
		the wall with a trophy composed of
		three pipes, a sabre, and a pair of pistols.
		After a visit to the grocer&#8217;s, over the way,
		where he bought a pound of candles and
		a bottle of rum, he returned, put his purchase
		on the mantle-shelf, and looked around
		him with an air of perfect satisfaction. And
		then, with the promptitude of the camp, he
		shaved without a mirror, brushed his coat,
		cocked his hat over his ear, and went for a
		walk in the village in search of a café.</p>

		<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>10</span>II.</h3>

		<p>It was an inveterate habit of the Captain
		to spend much of his time at a café. It was
		there that he satisfied at the same time the
		three vices which reigned supreme in his
		heart&#8212;tobacco, absinthe, and cards. It was
		thus that he passed his life, and he could
		have drawn a plan of all the places where
		he had ever been stationed by their tobacco
		shops, cafés, and military clubs. He never
		felt himself so thoroughly at ease as when
		sitting on a worn velvet bench before a
		square of green cloth near a heap of beer-mugs
		and saucers. His cigar never seemed
		good unless he struck his match under the
		marble of the table, and he never failed,
		after hanging his hat and his sabre on a
		hat-hook and settling himself comfortably,
		by unloosing one or two buttons of his coat,
		to breathe a profound sigh of relief, and exclaim,</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>11</span>&#8220;That is better!&#8221;</p>

		<p>His first care was, therefore, to find an establishment
		which he could frequent, and
		after having gone around the village without
		finding anything that suited him, he
		stopped at last to regard with the eye of a
		connoisseur the Café Prosper, situated at
		the corner of the Place du Marché and the
		Rue de la Pavoisse.</p>

		<p>It was not his ideal. Some of the details
		of the exterior were too provincial: the
		waiter, in his black apron, for example, the
		little stands in their green frames, the footstools,
		and the wooden tables covered with
		waxed cloth. But the interior pleased the
		Captain. He was delighted upon his entrance
		by the sound of the bell which was
		touched by the fair and fleshy dame du
		comptoir, in her light dress, with a poppy-colored
		ribbon in her sleek hair. He saluted
		her gallantly, and believed that she
		sustained with sufficient majesty her triumphal
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>12</span>place between two piles of punch-bowls
		properly crowned by billiard-balls. He
		ascertained that the place was cheerful,
		neat, and strewn evenly with yellow sand.
		He walked around it, looking at himself in
		the glasses as he passed; approved the panels
		where guardsmen and amazons were
		drinking champagne in a landscape filled
		with red holly-hocks; called for his absinthe,
		smoked, found the divan soft and the absinthe
		good, and was indulgent enough not
		to complain of the flies who bathed themselves
		in his glass with true rustic familiarity.</p>

		<p>Eight days later he had become one of
		the pillars of the Café Prosper.</p>

		<p>They soon learned his punctual habits
		and anticipated his wishes, while he, in turn,
		lunched with the patrons of the place&#8212;a
		valuable recruit for those who haunted the
		café, folks oppressed by the tedium of a
		country life, for whom the arrival of that
		new-comer, past master in all games, and
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>13</span>an admirable raconteur of his wars and his
		loves, was a true stroke of good-fortune.
		The Captain himself was delighted to tell his
		stories to folks who were still ignorant of his
		repertoire. <img class="figright" src="images/fig026.jpg" alt="A rotund man with small mustache stands with his hands in his pockets." /> There were fully
		six months before him in
		which to tell of his games,
		his feats, his battles, the
		retreat of Constantine, the
		capture of Bou-Maza, and
		the officers&#8217; receptions
		with the concomitant intoxication
		of rum-punch.</p>

		<p>Human weakness! He
		was by no means sorry, on
		his part, to be something
		of an oracle; he from whom the sub-lieutenants,
		new-comers at Saint-Cyr, fled dismayed,
		fearing his long stories.</p>

		<p>His usual auditors were the keeper of
		the café, a stupid and silent beer-cask, always
		in his sleeved vest, and remarkable
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>14</span>only for his carved pipe; the bailiff, a scoffer,
		dressed invariably in black, scorned for
		his inelegant habit of carrying off what remained
		of his sugar; the
		town-clerk, the gentleman
		of acrostics, a person of
		much amiability and a feeble
		constitution, who sent
		to the illustrated journals
		solutions of enigmas and rebuses;
		and, lastly, the veterinary surgeon of
		the place, the only one who, from his
		position of atheist and democrat, was allowed
		to contradict the Captain. <img class="figleft" src="images/fig027.jpg" alt="A bearded man wearing glasses sits with a glass before him." /> This practitioner,
		a man with tufted whiskers and
		eye-glasses, presided over the radical committee
		of electors, and when the curé took
		up a little collection among his devotees for
		the purpose of adorning his church with
		some frightful red and gilded statues, denounced,
		in a letter to the <i>Siècle</i>, the cupidity
		of the Jesuits.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>15</span>The Captain having gone out one evening
		for some cigars after an animated political
		discussion, the aforesaid veterinary grumbled
		to himself certain phrases of heavy irritation
		concerning &#8220;coming to the point,&#8221;
		and &#8220;a mere fencing-master,&#8221; and &#8220;cutting
		a figure.&#8221; But as the object of these vague
		menaces suddenly returned, whistling a
		march and beating time with his cane, the
		incident was without result.</p>

		<p>In short, the group lived harmoniously
		together, and willingly permitted themselves
		to be presided over by the new-comer, whose
		white beard and martial bearing were quite
		impressive. And the small city, proud of so
		many things, was also proud of its retired
		Captain.</p>


		<h3>III.</h3>

		<p>Perfect happiness exists nowhere, and
		Captain Mercadier, who believed that he
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>16</span>had found it at the Café Prosper, soon recovered
		from his illusion.</p>

		<p>For one thing, on Mondays, the market-day,
		the Café Prosper was untenantable.</p>

		<p>From early morning it was overrun with
		truck-peddlers, farmers, and poultrymen.
		Heavy men with coarse voices, red necks,
		and great whips in their hands, wearing blue
		blouses and otter-skin caps, bargaining over
		their cups, stamping their feet, striking their
		fists, familiar with the servant, and bungling
		at billiards.</p>

		<p>When the Captain came, at eleven o&#8217;clock,
		for his first glass of absinthe, he found this
		crowd gathered, and already half-drunk, ordering
		a quantity of lunches. His usual place
		was taken, and he was served slowly and
		badly. The bell was continually sounding,
		and the proprietor and the waiter, with napkins
		under their arms, were running distractedly
		hither and thither. In short, it was an ill-omened
		day, which upset his entire existence.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>17</span>Now, one Monday morning, when he was
		resting quietly at home, being sure that the
		café would be much too full and busy, the
		mild radiance of the autumn sun persuaded
		him to go down and sit upon the stone seat
		by the side of the house.</p>
		<div class="figcenter">
		<img src="images/fig030.jpg" alt="A dapper man with tophat and cane talks with a wretched-looking girl with a wooden leg. Three geese are nearby." />
		</div>
		<p class="continued"> He was sitting
		there, depressed and smoking a damp cigar,
		when he saw coming down the end of the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>18</span>street&#8212;it was a badly paved lane leading
		out into the country&#8212;a little girl of eight or
		ten, driving before her a half-dozen geese.</p>

		<p>As the Captain looked carelessly at the
		child he saw that she had a wooden leg.</p>

		<p>There was nothing paternal in the heart
		of the soldier. It was that of a hardened
		bachelor. In former days, in the streets of
		Algiers, when the little begging Arabs pursued
		him with their importunate prayers,
		the Captain had often chased them away
		with blows from his whip; and on those rare
		occasions when he had penetrated the nomadic
		household of some comrade who was
		married and the father of a family, he had
		gone away cursing the crying babies and
		awkward children who had touched with their
		greasy hands the gilding on his uniform.</p>

		<p>But the sight of that particular infirmity,
		which recalled to him the sad spectacle of
		wounds and amputations, touched, on that
		account, the old soldier. He felt almost a
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>19</span>constriction of the heart at the sight of that
		sorry creature, half-clothed in her tattered
		petticoats and old chemise, bravely running
		along behind her geese, her bare foot in the
		dust, and limping on her ill-made wooden
		stump.</p>

		<p>The geese, recognizing their home, turned
		into the poultry-yard, and the little one was
		about to follow them when the Captain
		stopped her with this question:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Eh! little girl, what&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Pierette, monsieur, at your service,&#8221; she
		answered, looking at him with her great
		black eyes, and pushing her disordered locks
		from her forehead.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You live in this house, then? I haven&#8217;t
		seen you before.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes, I know you pretty well, though, for
		I sleep under the stairs, and you wake me
		up every evening when you come home.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Is that so, my girl? Ah, well, I must walk
		on my toes in future. How old are you?&#8221;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>20</span>&#8220;Nine, monsieur, come All-Saints day.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Is the landlady here a relative of yours?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;No, monsieur, I am in service.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;And they give you?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Soup, and a bed under the stairs.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;And how came you to be lame like that,
		my poor little one?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;By the kick of a cow when I was five.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Have you a father or mother?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The child blushed under her sunburned
		skin. &#8220;I came from the Foundling Hospital,&#8221;
		she said, briefly. Then, with an awkward
		courtesy, she passed limping into the
		house, and the Captain heard, as she went
		away on the pavement of the court, the hard
		sound of the little wooden leg.</p>

		<p>Good heavens! he thought, mechanically
		walking towards his café, that&#8217;s not at all the
		thing. A soldier, at least, they pack off to
		the Invalides, with the money from his medal
		to keep him in tobacco. For an officer, they
		fix up a collectorship, and he marries somewhere
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>21</span>in the provinces. But this poor girl,
		with such an infirmity,&#8212;that&#8217;s not at all the
		thing!</p>

		<p>Having established in these terms the injustice
		of fate, the Captain reached the
		threshold of his dear café, but he saw there
		such a mob of blue blouses, he heard such a
		din of laughter and click of billiard-balls,
		that he returned home in very bad humor.</p>

		<p>His room&#8212;it was, perhaps, the first time
		that he had spent in it several hours of the day&#8212;looked
		rather shabby. His bed-curtains
		were the color of an old pipe. The fireplace
		was heaped with old cigar-stumps, and one
		could have written his name in the dust on
		the furniture. He contemplated for some
		time the walls where the sublime lancer of
		Leipsic rode a hundred times to a glorious
		death. Then, for an occupation, he passed
		his wardrobe in review. It was a lamentable
		series of bottomless pockets, socks full of
		holes, and shirts without buttons.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>22</span>&#8220;I must have a servant,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>Then he thought of the little lame girl.</p>

		<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;ll hire the next
		little room; winter is coming, and the little
		thing will freeze under the stairs. She will
		look after my clothes and my linen and
		keep the barracks clean. A valet, how&#8217;s
		that?&#8221;</p>

		<p>But a cloud darkened the comfortable picture.
		The Captain remembered that quarter-day
		was still a long way off, and that his
		account at the Cafe Prosper was assuming
		alarming proportions.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Not rich enough,&#8221; he said to himself.
		&#8220;And in the mean time they are robbing me
		down there. That is positive. The board
		is too high, and that wretch of a veterinary
		plays bezique much too well. I have paid
		his way now for eight days. Who knows?
		Perhaps I had better put the little one in
		charge of the mess, soup au café in the morning,
		stew at noon, and ragout every evening&#8212;campaign
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>23</span>life, in fact. I know all
		about that. Quite the thing to try.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Going out he saw at once the mistress of
		the house, a great brutal peasant, and the
		little lame girl, who both, with pitchforks in
		their hands, were turning over the dung-heap
		in the yard.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Does she know how to sew, to wash, to
		make soup?&#8221; he asked, brusquely.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Who&#8212;Pierette? Why?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Does she know a little of all that?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Of course. She came from an asylum
		where they learn how to take care of themselves.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Tell me, little one,&#8221; added the Captain,
		speaking to the child, &#8220;I am not scaring
		you&#8212;no? Well, my good woman, will you
		let me have her? I want a servant.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;If you will support her.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Then that is finished. Here are twenty
		francs. Let her have to-night a dress and a
		shoe. To-morrow we&#8217;ll arrange the rest.&#8221;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>24</span>And, with a friendly tap on Pierette&#8217;s
		cheek, the Captain went off, delighted that
		everything was concluded. Possibly he
		thought he would have to cut off some
		glasses of beer and absinthe, and be cautious
		of the veterinary&#8217;s skill at bezique.
		But that was not worth speaking of, and the
		new arrangement would be quite the thing.</p>


		<h3>IV.</h3>

		<p>Captain, you are a coward!</p>

		<p>Such was the apostrophe with which the
		caryatides of the Café Prosper hereafter
		greeted the Captain, whose visits became
		rarer day by day.</p>

		<p>For the poor man had not seen all the
		consequences of his good action. The suppression
		of his morning absinthe had been
		sufficient to cover the modest expense of
		Pierette&#8217;s keeping, but how many other reforms
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>25</span>were needed to provide for the unforeseen
		expenses of his bachelor establishment!
		Full of gratitude, the little girl wished to
		prove it by her zeal. Already the aspect of
		his room was changed. The furniture was
		dusted and arranged, the fireplace cleaned,
		the floor polished, and spiders no longer
		spun their webs over the deaths of Poniatowski
		in the corner. When the Captain came
		home the inviting odor of cabbage-soup saluted
		him on the staircase, and the sight of
		the smoking plates on the coarse but white
		table-cloth, with a bunch of flowers and polished
		table-ware, was quite enough to give
		him a good appetite. Pierette profited by
		the good-humor of her master to confess
		some of her secret ambitions. She wanted
		andirons for the fireplace, where there was
		now always a fire burning, and a mould for
		the little cakes that she knew how to make
		so well. And the Captain, smiling at the
		child&#8217;s requests, but charmed with the homelike
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>26</span><img class="figleft" src="images/fig039.jpg" alt="A man sits with his chin in his hand." />atmosphere of his
		room, promised to
		think of it, and on the
		morrow replaced his
		Londres by cigars for
		a sou each, hesitated
		to offer five points at
		ecarté, and refused his
		third glass of beer or his second glass of
		chartreuse.</p>

		<p>Certainly the struggle was long; it was
		cruel. Often, when the hour came for the
		glass that was denied him by economy, when
		thirst seized him by the throat, the Captain
		was forced to make an heroic effort to withdraw
		his hand already reaching out towards
		the swan&#8217;s beak of the café; many times he
		wandered about, dreaming of the king turned
		up and of quint and quatorze. But he almost
		always courageously returned home;
		and as he loved Pierette more through every
		sacrifice that he made for her, he embraced
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>27</span>her more fondly every day. For he
		did embrace her. She was no longer his
		servant. When once she stood before him
		at the table, calling him &#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; and
		so respectful in her bearing, he could not
		stand it, but seizing her by her two hands,
		he said to her, eagerly:</p>

		<p>&#8220;First embrace me, and then sit down
		and do me the pleasure of speaking familiarly,
		confound it!&#8221;</p>

		<p>And so to-day it is accomplished. Meeting
		a child has saved that man from an
		ignominious age.</p>

		<p>He has substituted for his old vices a
		young passion. He adores the little lame
		girl who skips around him in his room,
		which is comfortable and well furnished.</p>

		<p>He has already taught Pierette to read,
		and, moreover, recalling his calligraphy as a
		sergeant-major, he has set her copies in writing.
		It is his greatest joy when the child,
		bending attentively over her paper, and sometimes
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>28</span>making a blot which she quickly licks
		up with her tongue, has succeeded in copying
		all the letters of an interminable adverb
		in <i>ment</i>. His uneasiness is in thinking that
		he is growing old and has nothing to leave
		his adopted child.</p>

		<p>And so he becomes almost a miser; he
		theorizes; he wishes to give up his tobacco,
		although Pierette herself fills and lights his
		pipe for him. He counts on saving from
		his slender income enough to purchase a
		little stock of fancy goods. Then when he
		is dead she can live an obscure and tranquil
		life, hanging up somewhere in the back
		room of the small shop an old cross of the
		Legion of Honor, her souvenir of the Captain.</p>

		<p>Every day he goes to walk with her on
		the rampart. Sometimes they are passed by
		folks who are strangers in the village, who
		look with compassionate surprise at the old
		soldier, spared from the wars, and the poor
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>29</span>lame child. And he is moved&#8212;oh, so pleasantly,
		almost to tears&#8212;when one of the
		passers-by whispers, as they pass:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Poor father! Yet how pretty his daughter
		is.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The night was clear and
		glittering with stars, and there
		was a crowd upon the market-place. They
		crowded in gaping delight around the tent
		of some strolling acrobats, where red and
		smoking lanterns lighted the performance
		which was just beginning. Rolling their
		muscular limbs in dirty wraps, and decorated
		from head to foot with tawdry ruffles of
		fur, the athletes&#8212;four boyish ruffians with
		vulgar heads&#8212;were ranged in line before
		the painted canvas which represented their
		exploits; they stood there with their heads
		down, their legs apart, and their muscular
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>34</span>arms crossed upon their chests. Near them
		the marshal of the establishment, an old
		sub-officer, with the drooping mustache of
		a brandy-drinker, belted in at the waist, a
		heart of red cloth on his leather breastplate,
		leaned on a pair of foils. The feminine
		attraction, a rose in her hair, with a man&#8217;s
		overcoat protecting her against the freshness
		of the evening air over her ballet-dancer&#8217;s
		dress, played at the same time the
		cymbals and the big bass-drum a desperate
		accompaniment to three measures of a polka,
		always the same, which were murdered by a
		blind clarionet player; and the ringmaster,
		a sort of Hercules with the face of a galley-slave,
		a Silenus in scarlet drawers, roared
		out his furious appeal in a loud voice.
		Mixed with the crowd of loafers, soldiers,
		and women, I regarded the abject spectacle
		with disgust&#8212;the last vestige of the olympic
		games.</p>

		<p>Suddenly the music ceased, and the crowd
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>35</span>broke into roars of laughter. The clown had
		just made his appearance.</p>

		<p>He wore the ordinary costume of his kind,
		the short vest and many-colored stockings
		of the peasants of the opera comique, the
		three horns turned
		backward, the red wig
		with its turned-up
		queue and its butterfly
		on the end. <img class="figright" src="images/fig048.jpg" alt="A 3/4-length portrait of a clown, with arms akimbo." />He
		was a young man, but
		alas, his face, whitened
		with flour, was
		already seamed with
		vice. Planting himself before the public,
		and opening his mouth in a silly grin, he
		showed bleeding gums almost devoid of
		teeth. The ringmaster kicked him violently
		from behind.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; he said, tranquilly.</p>

		<p>Then the traditional dialogue, punctuated
		by slaps in the face, began between the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>36</span>mountebank and his clown, and the entire
		audience applauded these souvenirs of the
		classic farce, fallen from the theatre to the
		stage of the mountebank, and whose humor,
		coarse but pungent, seemed a drunken echo
		of the laughter of Molière. The clown exerted
		his low talent, throwing out at each
		moment some low jest, some immodest pun,
		to which his master, simulating a prudish
		indignation, responded by thumps on the
		head. But the adroit clown excelled in the
		art of receiving affronts. He knew to perfection
		how to bend his body like a bow
		under the impulse of a kick, and having received
		on one cheek a full-armed blow, he
		stuffed his tongue at once in that cheek
		and began to whine until a new blow passed
		the artificial swelling into the other cheek.
		Blows showered on him as thick as hail, and,
		disappearing under a shower of slaps, the
		flour on his face and the red powder of his
		wig enveloped him like a cloud. At last he
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>37</span>exhausted all his resources of low scurrility,
		ridiculous contortions, grotesque grimaces,
		pretended aches, falls at full length, etc., till
		the ringmaster, judging this gratuitous show
		long enough, and that the public were sufficiently
		fascinated, sent him off with a final
		cuff.</p>

		<p>Then the music began again with such
		violence that the painted canvas trembled.
		The clown, having seized the sticks of a
		drum fixed on one of the beams of the scaffolding,
		mingled a triumphant rataplan with
		the bombardment of the bass-drum, the
		cracked thunder of the cymbals, and the
		distracted wail of the clarionet. The ringmaster,
		roaring again with his heavy voice,
		announced that the show was about to begin,
		and, as a sign of defiance, he threw two
		or three old fencing-gloves among his fellow-wrestlers.
		The crowd rushed into the
		tent, and soon only a small group of loungers
		remained in front of the deserted stage.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>38</span>I was just going off, when I noticed by
		my side an old woman who looked with
		strange persistence at the empty stage where
		the red lights were still burning. She wore
		the linen bonnet and the crossed fichu of
		the poorer class of women, and her whole
		appearance was that of neatness and honesty.
		Asking myself what powerful interest
		could hold her in such a place, I looked at
		her with more attention, and I saw that her
		eyes were full of tears, and that her hands,
		which she had crossed over her breast, were
		trembling with emotion.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; I said,
		coming near to her, impelled by an instinctive
		sympathy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The matter, good sir?&#8221; cried the old
		woman, bursting into tears. &#8220;Passing by
		this market-place&#8212;oh, quite by chance, I
		tell you (I have no heart for pleasure)&#8212;passing
		before that dreadful tent, I have just
		seen in the wretch who has received all those
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>39</span>blows my only son, sir, my sole child! It is
		the grief of my life, do you see? I never
		knew what had become of him since&#8212;oh,
		since my poor husband sent him away to
		sea as a cabin-boy. He was apprenticed to
		an ironmonger, sir. He robbed his master&#8212;he,
		the son of two honest people. As for
		me, I would have pardoned him. You know
		what mothers are. But my man, when they
		came and told him that his son had stolen,
		he was like a madman. It was that that
		killed him, I am sure. I have never seen
		the unhappy child again. For five years I
		have heard nothing from him. I sought to
		deceive myself. I said experience will reform
		him, and there&#8212;there&#8212;just now&#8212;&#8221;</p>

		<p>And the poor old woman sobbed in a pitiful
		way. A crowd had formed. It was no
		longer to me that she spoke; it was not to
		the crowd; it was to herself, to the bitterness
		of her own heart.</p>

		<p>&#8220;He, my Adrien, the child that I nourished
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>40</span>at my own breast, a mountebank in a
		travelling theatre! struck and insulted before
		the whole world! He, whom I saved
		at four when he was so ill, a clown in a tent!
		He, the beautiful baby of whom I was so
		proud, whom I made the neighbors admire
		when he was so small that he rolled naked
		on my knee, holding his little foot in his
		hand!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Suddenly at this point in her heart-breaking
		monologue the old woman perceived the
		crowd listening to her. She looked on the
		spectators in astonishment, as one who starts
		from sleep. She recognized me who had
		questioned her, and became frightfully pale.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What have I said?&#8221; she stammered.
		&#8220;Let me pass.&#8221; And brusquely putting us
		aside with an imperious gesture, she went
		off with a rapid step, and disappeared in the
		night.</p>

		<p>The adventure made a lively impression
		on me. I thought often of it, and after that,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>41</span>when I saw before my eyes some wretched
		and degraded creature, some woman of the
		street, trailing her light silk skirts in the flare
		of a gas-jet, some drunken idler leaning on
		the bar of a café and bending his bloated
		face over his glass of absinthe, I have
		thought, &#8220;Is it possible that that being can
		ever have been a little child?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Now, some little time after that <i>rencontre</i>&#8212;let
		us be careful not to indicate the date&#8212;I
		was taken into a gallery of the Chamber
		of Deputies to be present at a sensational
		sitting. The law that they were discussing
		on that day is of no importance, but it was
		the old and tedious story: a Ministerial candidate,
		formerly in the Opposition, proposed
		to strike a blow at some liberty&#8212;I don&#8217;t
		know what&#8212;which he had formerly demanded
		with virulence and force. And, more
		than that, the man in power was going to
		forfeit his word to the tribune. In good
		French that is called &#8220;to betray,&#8221; but in
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>42</span>parliamentary language they employ the
		phrase, &#8220;accomplish a change of base.&#8221;
		Opinion was divided, the majority uncertain;
		and upon his speech would depend the political
		future of the speaker. Therefore, on
		that day, the legislators were in their places,
		and the Chamber did not resemble, as usual,
		a class of noisy boys presided over by a
		master without authority. The lunch-counter
		was deserted, and the deputies of the
		Centre themselves were not absorbed in their
		personal correspondence.</p>

		<p>The orator mounted the tribune. He had
		the commonplace figure of a verbose orator:
		bold eye, protruding lips, as enlarged by the
		abuse of words. He began by fingering his
		notes with an important air, tasting the glass
		of sweetened water, and settling himself in
		his place; then he started a babble of words
		without sense, with the nauseous facility of
		the bar; misusing vague ideas, abstract
		terms, and words in <i>ly</i> and <i>ion</i>, stereotyped
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>43</span>words, and ready-made phrases. A flattering
		murmur greeted the end of his exordium;
		for the French people in general, and the
		political world in particular, manifest a depraved
		taste for that sort of eloquence. Encouraged,
		the fine speaker entered the heart
		of his subject, and cynically sang his recantation.
		He abjured none of his opinions, he
		repudiated none of his acts; he would always
		remain liberal (a blow on his chest),
		but that which was good yesterday might
		be dangerous to-day; truth on the other
		side of the Alps, error on this side. The
		forbearance of the Government was abused.
		And he threatened the assembly; became
		prophet; let loose the dogs of war. He
		even risked a bit of poetry, flourished old
		metaphors, which were worn out in the time
		of Cicero, and compared by turn, in the
		same phrase, his political career to a pilot, a
		steed, and a torch. So much poetry could
		only accentuate his success. There was a
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44"></a>44</span>salvo of bravos, and the Opposition grumbled,
		foreseeing their defeat. Violent interruptions
		broke forth: furious voices recalled
		the orator&#8217;s past life, and threw as insults his
		former professions in his face. He was unmoved,
		and stood with a disdainful air, which
		was very effective. <img class="figleft" src="images/fig057.jpg" alt="An orating man." />
		Then the bravos redoubled,
		and he
		smiled vaguely, thinking,
		no doubt, of the
		proof-sheets of the
		<i>Officiel</i>, where he
		could by-and-by insert
		in the margin,
		without too much exaggeration,
		&#8220;profound sensation&#8221; and &#8220;prolonged
		applause.&#8221; Then, when quiet was
		re-established, sure of his success, he affected
		a serene majesty. He took up again his
		discourse, soaring like a goose, launching
		out with high doctrine, citing Royer-Collard.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name="page45"></a>45</span>But I heard no more. The scandalous
		spectacle of that political mountebank, who
		sacrificed eternal principles to the interests
		of the day, recalled to my memory the tent
		of the acrobats. The cold rhetoric of that
		harangue, vibrating with neither truth nor
		emotion, recalled to me the patter, learned
		by heart, of the powdered clown on the
		stage. The superb air which the orator assumed
		under the rain of reproaches and insults
		singularly resembled the indifference
		of the clown to the loud slaps on his face.
		Those sonorous phrases, whose echoes had
		just died away, sounded as false as a strolling
		band. The word &#8220;liberty&#8221; rolled like
		the bass-drum, &#8220;public interests&#8221; and &#8220;welfare
		of the State&#8221; clanged discordantly like
		the cymbals, and when the comedian spoke
		of his &#8220;patriotism&#8221; I almost heard the <i>couac</i>
		of a clarionet.</p>

		<p>A long uproar woke me from my revery.
		The speech was finished, and the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>46</span>orator, having descended from the rostrum,
		was receiving congratulations. They were
		about to vote: the urns were being passed
		around, but the result was certain, and
		the crowd of tribunes was already dispersing.</p>

		<p>As I went across the vestibule I saw an
		elderly lady dressed in black. She was
		dressed like a wealthy bourgeoise and appeared
		radiant. I stopped one of the well-groomed
		little chaps whom one sees trotting
		around in the Ministerial corridors. I
		knew him slightly, and I asked him who
		that lady was.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The mother of the orator,&#8221; he replied,
		with official emotion. &#8220;She must be very
		proud.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Very proud! The old mother who wept
		so bitterly in the market-place was not that;
		and if the mother of his future Excellency
		had reflected, she would have regretted&#8212;she
		too&#8212;the time when her boy was very small,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>47</span>and rolled naked on her knee, holding his
		little foot in his hand.</p>

		<p>But, bah! everything is relative, even
		shame.</p>

		<p>I knew the poet Louis Miraz very well,
		in the old times in the Latin Quarter, where
		we used to take our meals together at a
		crémerie on the Rue de Seine, kept by an
		old Polish woman whom we nicknamed the
		Princess Chocolawska, on account of the
		enormous bowl of créme and chocolate
		which she exposed daily in the show-window
		of her shop. It was possible to dine there
		for ten sous, with &#8220;two breads,&#8221; an &#8220;ordinaire
		for thirty centimes,&#8221; and a &#8220;small
		coffee.&#8221;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>52</span>Some who were very nice spent a sou
		more for a napkin.</p>

		<p>Besides some young men who were destined
		to become geniuses, the ordinary
		guests of the crémerie were some poor compatriots
		of the proprietress, who had all to
		some extent commanded armies. There
		was, above all, an imposing and melancholy
		old fellow with a white beard, whose old
		befrogged cloak, shabby boots, and old hat,
		which looked as if snails had crawled over
		it, presented a poem of misery, and whom
		the other Poles treated with a marked respect,
		for he had been a dictator for three
		days.</p>

		<p>It was, moreover, at the Princess Chocolawska&#8217;s
		that I knew a singular fool, who
		gained his bread by giving German lessons,
		and declared himself a convert to Buddhism.
		On the mantle of the miserable room, where
		he lived with a milliner of Saint-Germain,
		was enthroned an ugly little Buddha in jade,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>53</span>fixing his hypnotized eyes on his navel, and
		holding his great toes in his hands. The
		German professor accorded to the idol the
		most profound veneration, but on the epoch
		of quarter-day he was sometimes forced to
		carry him to the Mont-de-piété, upon which
		he fell into a state of sombre chagrin, and
		did not recover his serenity until he was
		able to make amends for his impious act.
		He never failed, moreover, to renew his
		avowals in prosperous times, and finally to
		take his god out of pawn.</p>

		<p>As to Louis Miraz, he had the deep eyes,
		the pale complexion, and the long and dishevelled
		hair of all those young men who
		come to town in third-class carriages to
		conquer glory, who spend more for midnight
		oil than for beefsteaks, and who, rich already
		with some manuscripts, have thrown out to
		great Paris from the height of some hill in
		its environs the classic defiance of Rastignac.
		At that time my hair was archaic
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name="page54"></a>54</span>enough in length to grease the collar of my
		coat. Thus we were made to understand
		each other, and Louis Miraz soon took me
		to his attic-room in the Rue des Quatre-Vents,
		where he dragged two thousand alexandrines
		over me.</p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<img src="images/fig067.jpg" alt="Two men having a conversation at a table." />
		</div>

		<p>Seriously, they were fresh and charming
		verses, with the inspiration of spring-tide,
		having the perfume of the first lilacs, and
		<i>Forest Birds</i> (the title of that collection of
		poems which Louis Miraz published a little
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>55</span>while after he read them to me) will retain
		a place among the volumes in the first rank
		of belles-lettres, by the side of those poets of
		a single book&#8212;of the Daudet of the Amoureuses,
		for example.</p>

		<p>For Miraz wrote no more verse. A young
		eaglet seeking the upper air, he made his
		eyrie on the summit of Montmartre, and for
		quite a while we lost sight of him. Then I
		found his name again in Sunday journals
		and reviews, when he began to write those
		short and exquisite sketches which have
		made his reputation. Thus five years passed,
		when I met him one day in the editor&#8217;s
		office of a journal for which I worked.</p>


		<p class="thought_break_asterism">&#x2042;</p>

		<p>Each of us was as much pleased as the
		other at thus meeting again; and after the
		first &#8220;What, is that you? Is that you?&#8221; we
		stood facing each other, shaking hands, and
		exposing, in a laugh of cordial delight, our
		teeth, which in old times we used to exercise
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>56</span>on the same crust of poverty. He had not
		changed. He had not even sacrificed his
		long hair, which he threw back with the
		graceful movement of a horse who tosses
		his mane. Only he had the clear complexion
		and calm eye of a contented man, and
		his slim figure was clad in most fashionable
		costume.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t drift apart again, will we?&#8221;
		said he, affectionately, taking me by the arm;
		and he led me out in the boulevard, where
		the April sun gilded the young leaves of the
		plane-trees.</p>

		<p>Ah, happy day! How we exhausted the
		&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remembers?&#8221; &#8220;Do you remember
		the fried eggs which tasted of straw, and
		the dreadful rice-milk of the Princess Chocolawska?
		and the melancholy air of the
		old dictator? and the German who used to
		pawn his god every three months?&#8221; At last
		those days of hardship were finished. He
		had from afar applauded my success, as I
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page57" name="page57"></a>57</span>had watched his. But one thing I did not
		know, and that was that he had married a
		woman whom he adored, and that he had a
		charming little girl.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Come and see them; you shall dine
		with me.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I let myself be persuaded, and he carried
		me down to the Enclos des Ternes, where
		he lived in a cottage among the trees.
		There everything made you welcome. No
		sooner had we opened the door of the garden
		than a young dog frisked about our
		feet.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Down, Gavroche! He will soil your
		clothes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>But at the sound of the bell Madame
		Miraz appeared at the steps with her little
		daughter in her arms. An imposing and
		beautiful blond, her well-moulded figure
		wrapped in a blue gown.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Put on a plate more. I&#8217;ve an old comrade
		with me.&#8221;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name="page58"></a>58</span>And the happy father, keeping his hat on
		his head and carrying his little girl, showed
		me all over his establishment&#8212;the dining-room,
		brightened by light bits of faience,
		the study, abounding in books, with its window
		opening out on the green turf, so that a
		puff of wind had strewn with rose-leaves the
		printer&#8217;s proofs which were scattered on the
		table.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This is only a beginning, you know. It
		wasn&#8217;t so long ago that we were working
		for three sous a line.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And while I luxuriated under a blossoming
		Judas-tree which I saw in the garden,
		Miraz, at ease in his home, had slipped into
		his working-vest, put on his slippers, and,
		lying on his sofa, caught little Helen in
		his arms to toss her in the air&#8212;&#8220;Houp
		la! Houp la!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I do not remember ever to have had a
		more perfect impression of contentment.
		We dined pleasantly&#8212;two good courses,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>59</span>that was all; a dinner without pretence,
		where we served ourselves with the pepper-mill.
		The charming Madame Miraz presided
		with her bright smile, having her child
		by her side in a high-chair. She spoke but
		little, but her sweet and intelligent attention
		followed our light and paradoxical chat,
		the good-humored fooling of men of letters;
		and at the dessert she took a rose from the
		bouquet which ornamented the table, and
		placed it in her hair near her ear with a supreme
		grace. She was indeed that lovely
		and silent friend whom a dreamer requires.</p>

		<p>We took our coffee in the study&#8212;they intended
		to furnish the salon very soon with
		the price of a story to be published by Levy&#8212;then,
		as the evening was cool, a fire of
		sticks and twigs was built, and while we
		smoked, Miraz and I, recalling old memories,
		the mistress of the house, holding on her
		knees little Helen, now ready for bed, made
		her repeat &#8220;Our Father&#8221; and &#8220;Hail Mary,&#8221;
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>60</span>which the little one lisped, rubbing her little
		feet together before the warm flame.</p>

		<p class="thought_break_asterism">&#x2042;</p>

		<p>We saw each other again, often at first,
		then less frequently, the difficult and complicated
		life of literary labor taking us each
		his own way. So the years passed. We
		met, shook hands. &#8220;Everything going well?&#8221;
		&#8220;Splendidly.&#8221; And that was all. Then,
		later, I found the name of Louis Miraz but
		rarely in the journals and periodicals. &#8220;Happy
		man; he is resting,&#8221; I said to myself, remembering
		that he was spoken of as having
		made a small fortune. Finally, last autumn,
		I learned that he was seriously ill.</p>

		<p>I hurried to see him. He still lived at
		the Enclos des Ternes; but on this sombre
		day of the last of November the little house
		seemed cold, and looked naked among the
		leafless trees. It seemed to me shrunken
		and diminished, like everything that we have
		not seen for a long time.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>61</span>The dog was probably dead, for his bark
		no longer answered the sound of the bell
		when I passed the little gate and entered
		the garden, all strewn with dead leaves where
		the night&#8217;s frost had withered the last chrysanthemums.</p>

		<p>It was not Madame Miraz&#8212;she was absent&#8212;it
		was Helen who received me, Helen,
		who had grown to be a great girl of fourteen,
		with an awkward manner. She opened
		for me the door of her father&#8217;s study,
		and brusquely lifting her great black eyelashes,
		turned on me a timid and distressed
		glance.</p>

		<p>I found Miraz huddled in an easy-chair
		in the corner of the fireplace, wrapped in a
		sort of bed-gown, with gray locks streaking
		his long hair; and by the cold, clammy hand
		which he reached towards me, by the pallid
		face which he turned upon me, I knew that
		he was lost. Horrible! I found in my unhappy
		comrade that worn and ruined look
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name="page62"></a>62</span>which used to strike us formerly among the
		poor Poles of the crémerie.</p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<img src="images/fig075.jpg" alt="A man in robe and slippers naps in a chair in a study." />
		</div>

		<p>&#8220;Ah, well, old man, things are not going
		well?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Deucedly bad, my boy,&#8221; he answered,
		with a heart-breaking smile. &#8220;I am going
		out stupidly with consumption, as they do
		in the fifth act, you know, when the venerable
		doctor, with a head like Béranger, feels
		the first walking gentleman&#8217;s pulse, and lifts
		his eyes towards heaven, saying, &#8216;The death-struggle
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>63</span>approaches!&#8217; Only the difference
		is that with me it continues; it will not conclude,
		the death-struggle. Smoke away;
		that doesn&#8217;t disturb me,&#8221; he added, seeing
		me put my cigar one side, his cough sounding
		like a death-rattle.</p>

		<p>I tried to find encouraging words. I talked
		with him, holding him by the hand and
		patting him affectionately on the shoulder;
		but my voice had in my own ears the empty
		hollowness of deceit, and Miraz, looking at
		me, seemed to pity my efforts.</p>

		<p>I was silent.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said he, pointing to his table;
		&#8220;see my work-bench. For six months I
		have not been able to write.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It was true. Nothing could be more sad
		than that heap of papers covered with dust,
		and in an old Roman plate there was a bundle
		of pens, crusted with ink, and like those
		trophies of rusty foils which hang on the
		walls of old fencers.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name="page64"></a>64</span>I made a new attempt to revive him. Die!
		at his age. Nonsense! He wasn&#8217;t taking
		care of himself. He must pass the winter
		in the South, drink a good draught of sunlight.
		He could. He was easy in his money
		matters.</p>

		<p>But he stopped me, putting his hand on
		my arm.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he said, gravely, &#8220;we have seen
		each other seldom, but you are my oldest,
		perhaps my best, friend. You have proved
		me pen in hand. Well, I am going to tell
		you something in confidence, for you to keep
		to yourself, unless it may serve on some occasion
		to discourage the young literary aspirants
		who bring their manuscripts to you&#8212;always
		a praiseworthy action. Yes, I have
		been successful. Yes, I have been paid a
		franc a line. Yes, I have made money, and
		there in that drawer are a certain number
		of yellow, green, and red papers from
		which a bit is clipped every six months,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page65" name="page65"></a>65</span>and which represent three or four thousand
		francs of income. It is rare in our profession,
		and to gain that poor hoard I have
		been obliged&#8212;I, a poet&#8212;to imitate the unsociable
		virtues of a bourgeois, know how to
		deny a jewel to my wife, a dress to my daughter.
		At last I have that money. And I
		often said to myself, if I should die their
		bread is assured, and here is a little marriage
		portion for Helen! And I was content&#8212;I
		was proud!&#8212;for I know them, the
		stories of our widows and our orphans, the
		fourpenny help of the government, the tobacco
		shops for six hundred francs in the
		province, and, if the daughter is intelligent
		and pretty like mine, the dramatic author,
		an old friend of the father, who advises her
		to enter the Conservatoire, and who makes
		of her&#8212;mercy of God! that shall never be.
		But for all that, my boy, it is necessary that
		I should not linger. Sickness is expensive,
		and already it has been necessary to sell
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name="page66"></a>66</span>one or two bonds from that drawer. To
		seek the sunlight, as you suggest, to bask
		like a lizard at Cannes or at Menton, one
		more bond must go, and there would not be
		enough to last to the end, if I should wait
		for seven or eight years more, now that I
		can no longer write. Happily, there is nothing
		to fear. But what I have suffered since
		I have been incapable of writing, and have
		felt my hoard of gold shrink and diminish
		in my hand like the Magic Skin of Balzac, is
		frightful. Now you understand me, do you
		not? and you will no longer bid me take
		care of myself. No; if you still pray to God,
		ask him to send me speedily to the undertaker&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

		<p class="thought_break_asterism">&#x2042;</p>

		<p>Fifteen days later some thirty of us followed
		the hearse which carried Louis Miraz
		to the Cemetery Montmartre. It had snowed
		the day before, and Doctor Arnould, the
		old frequenter of painters&#8217; studios, the friend
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>67</span>and physician of the dead man, walking behind
		me, called in his brusque voice,</p>

		<p>&#8220;Very commonplace, but always terrible
		the contrast: a burial in the snow&#8212;black
		on white. The Funeral of the Poor, by the
		late Vigneron, isn&#8217;t to be ridiculed. Brr!&#8221;</p>

		<p>At last we came to the edge of the grave.
		The place and the time were sad. Under a
		cloudy sky the little yew-trees, swayed by the
		wind, threw down their burdens of melted
		snow. The by-standers had formed a circle,
		and were watching the grave-diggers, who
		were lowering the coffin by cords. Near a
		cross-bearer, whose short surplice permitted
		the bottom of his trousers to be seen, the
		priest waited with a finger in his book; and,
		having grasped the rim of his hat under his
		left arm, the orator of the Society of Men of
		Letters already held in his black-gloved hand
		the funeral oration, hastily patched up by the
		aid of a comrade over a couple of glasses at
		the corner of a café table.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name="page68"></a>68</span>Suddenly, as the priest began his Latin
		prayers, Doctor Arnould seized me by the
		arm and whispered in my ear,</p>

		<p>&#8220;You know that he killed himself?&#8221;</p>

		<p>I looked at him with astonishment. But
		he pointed to the group in black, composed
		of Madame Miraz and her daughter, who
		were sobbing under their long veils and
		clasping each other in a tragic embrace, and
		he added,</p>

		<p>&#8220;For them. Yes, for six months he threw
		all his medicines in the fire, and designedly
		committed all sorts of imprudences. He
		confessed it to me before his death. I had
		not understood it at all&#8212;I, who had expected
		to prolong his life at least three years by
		creosote. At last the other night, when it
		was freezing cold, he left his window open,
		as if by forgetfulness, and was taken with
		bleeding at the lungs. Yes, that he might
		leave bread for those two women. The
		curé does not dream that he is blessing a
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page69" name="page69"></a>69</span>suicide. But what of it, my good fellow?
		Miraz is in the paradise of the brave. The
		details of such a death. Eh? It is tougher
		than the passage of the Bridge of Arcole.&#8221;</p>

		<p>For twenty-five years he had played the
		role of the villain at the Boulevard du Crime,<span class="fnmarker">*</span><span class="footnote">* A nickname given to the Boulevard du Temple, on account of the numerous melodramatic theatres situated there.</span>
		and his harsh voice, his nose like an eagle&#8217;s
		beak, his eye with its savage glitter, had
		made him a good player of such parts. For
		twenty-five years, dressed in the cloak and
		encircled by the fawn-colored leather belt
		of Mordaunt, he had retreated with the step
		of a wounded scorpion before the sword of
		D&#8217;Artagnan; draped in the dirty Jewish
		gown of Rodin, he had rubbed his dry
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name="page74"></a>74</span>hands together, muttering the terrible &#8220;Patience,
		patience!&#8221; and, curled on the chair
		of the Duc d&#8217;Este, he had said to Lucretia
		Borgia, with a sufficiently infernal glance, <img class="figleft" src="images/fig087.jpg" alt="A man in a flat-topped hat." />
		&#8220;Take care and make no
		mistake. The flagon of gold,
		madame.&#8221; When, preceded
		by a tremolo, he made his entry
		in the scene, the third
		gallery trembled, and a sigh
		of relief greeted the moment
		when the first walking gentleman at last
		said to him: &#8220;Between us two, now,&#8221; and
		immolated him for the grand triumph of
		virtue.</p>

		<p>But this sort of success, which is only betrayed
		by murmurs of horror, is not of the
		kind to make a dramatic career seductive;
		and besides the old actor had always hidden
		in a corner of his heart the bucolic ideal
		which is in the heart of almost all artists.
		He sighed for an old age of leisure, and the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page75" name="page75"></a>75</span>comfortable dignity of a retired shopkeeper;
		the house in the country, where he could live
		with his family, with melons, under an arbor;
		cakes and wine in the winter evenings; his
		daughter a scholar in a convent; his son in
		the uniform of the Polytechnique; and the
		cross of the Legion.</p>

		<p>Now, when we had occasion to know him,
		he had already nearly realized his dreams.</p>

		<p>After the failure of the theatre where he
		had been for a long time engaged, some
		capitalists had thought of him to put the
		enterprise on its feet again. With his systematic
		habits, his good sense, his thorough and
		practical knowledge of the business, and a
		sufficiently correct literary instinct, he became
		an excellent manager. He was the
		owner of stocks and a villa at Montmorency;
		his son was a student at Sainte-Barbe, and
		his daughter had just come out of Les Oiseaux;
		and if the malice of small newspapers
		had retarded his nomination in the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name="page76"></a>76</span>Legion of Honor by recalling every year,
		about the first of January, his old ranting
		on the stage, when he played formerly the
		villains&#8217; parts, he could yet hope that it would
		not be long before the red ribbon would
		flourish in his button-hole. He had still
		preserved some of the habits of a strolling
		player, such as being very familiar with everybody,
		and dyeing his mustaches; but as
		he was, on the whole, good, honest, and serviceable,
		he conquered the esteem and friendship
		of those with whom he came in contact.</p>

		<p>So it was with sincere grief that the whole
		dramatic world learned one day the terrible
		sorrow which had smitten that excellent
		man. His daughter, a girl of seventeen,
		had died suddenly of brain-fever.</p>

		<p>We knew how he adored the child; how
		he had brought her up in the strictest principles
		of family and religion, far from the theatre,
		something as Triboulet hid his daughter
		Blanche in the little house of the cul-de-sac
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page77" name="page77"></a>77</span>Bucy. <img class="figright" src="images/fig090.jpg" alt="Three men in a group; one's back is to us." />We understood
		that all the
		hopes and ambitions
		of the man rested on
		the head of that
		charming girl, who,
		near all the corruption
		of the theatre,
		had grown up in innocence
		and purity, as
		one sees sometimes
		in the scanty grass of
		the faubourgs a field-flower
		spring up by
		the door of a hovel.</p>

		<p>We were among the first at the funeral, to
		which we had been summoned by a black-bordered
		billet.</p>

		<p>A crowd of the people of the neighborhood
		encumbered the street before the house
		of the dead, attracted by the pomps of the
		first-class funeral ordered by the old comedian,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page78" name="page78"></a>78</span>who had preserved the taste of the <i>mise
		en scène</i> even in his grief. The magnificent
		hearse and cumbrous mourning-coaches
		were already drawn up to the sidewalk, and
		under the door, and in the shade of the
		heavy fringed and silvered draperies, amid
		the twinkling of burning candles, between
		two priests reading prayers in their Prayer-books,
		the form of the massive coffin could
		be seen under its white cloth, covered with
		Parma violets.</p>

		<p>As we walked among the crowd we noticed
		the groups formed of those who, like us,
		were waiting the departure of the cortége.
		There were almost all the actors, men and
		women, of Paris, who had come to pay
		their last respects to the daughter of their
		comrade. Undoubtedly nothing could be
		more natural; but we experienced not the
		less a strange sensation on seeing, around
		the coffin of that pure young girl who had
		breathed away her last breath in a prayer,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page79" name="page79"></a>79</span>the gathering of all those faces marked by
		the brand of the theatre.</p>

		<p>They were all there: the stars, the comedians,
		the lovers, the traitors; nobody was
		lacking: soubrettes, duennas, coquettes, first
		walking ladies. </p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<img src="images/fig092.jpg" alt="Two men stand talking." />
		</div>

		<p class="continued">Wearing a sack-coat and a
		felt hat on his long gray hair, the superb
		adventurer of all the cloak and sword dramas
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page80" name="page80"></a>80</span>leaned against the shutter of a shop in his
		familiar attitude, and crossed his arms to
		show his handsome hands; while a little
		old fellow with the wrinkled face of a clown
		spoke to him briskly in the broad, harsh
		voice which had so often made us explode
		with laughter. By the side of the aged first
		young man, who, pinched in his scanty
		frock-coat, and with trousers trailing under
		foot, twirled in his gloved hands his locks
		of over-black hair, stood a great handsome
		fellow, beautiful as a model, who had not
		been able to renounce even for that day his
		eccentricities of costume, and strutted in a
		black velvet cape and the boots of an
		equerry. Oh, how sad, tired, and old they
		seemed in the gray light of that winter
		morning, all those pathetic heads, graceful
		or laughable, which we were only in the
		habit of seeing when transfigured by the
		prestige of the stage. Chins had become
		blue-black under too frequent shaving; hair
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>81</span>thin and dry under the hot
		iron of the hair-dresser; <img class="figright" src="images/fig094.jpg" alt="A full-length portrait of a man in a draped cloak." />
		skins rough under the injurious
		action of unguents and
		vinegar; eyes dull, burned
		by the glare of foot-lights&#8212;blinded,
		almost fixed, like
		those of an owl in the sunlight.</p>

		<p>The women were especially
		to be pitied. Obliged
		by the occasion to rise at
		a very early hour, and not
		having had the time for a
		careful and minute toilet, they gathered in
		groups of four or five, chilled and shivering
		in their fur mantles, muffs, and triple black
		veils. Notwithstanding the hasty rouge and
		powder of the morning, they were unrecognizable,
		and it required an effort of imagination
		to find in them a memory of that
		sublime seraglio of the Parisian theatres,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>82</span>exposed every evening to the desires of several
		thousand men. On all of these charming
		types appeared the mark of weariness
		and age.</p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<img src="images/fig095.jpg" alt="Three women stand in a group." />
		</div>

		<p class="continued">Some ossified into faded skeletons,
		others grew dull with an unhealthy
		weight of fat; wrinkles crossed the foreheads
		and starred the temples; lips were
		livid and eyes circled with dark rings; the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>83</span>complexions were particularly frightful&#8212;that
		uniform tint, morbid and sickly, the work of
		rouge and grease-paints. That heavy woman,
		with the head and neck of a farmer&#8217;s
		wife (one almost sees a basket on her shoulder),
		is the terrible and fatal queen of grand,
		romantic dramas; and that small blonde and
		pale creature, so faded under her laces, and
		who would have completely filled a music-teacher&#8217;s
		carrying roll, was the artless young
		woman whom all the vaudevillists married
		at the dénouement of their pieces. There
		were the dying glances of the lorette in the
		hospital, the pose of the old copyist of the
		Louvre, and the theatrical sneer.</p>

		<p>Soon the cabs drove up with the functionaries
		connected with the administration of
		the theatre, in black hats and coats, with an
		official air of sadness; young reporters, the
		outflow of journalism, staring at everybody
		and taking notes; dramatic authors, Monday
		feuilletonists&#8212;in short, all of those
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>84</span>nocturnal beings, tired and worn-out, who are
		properly called the actives of Paris.</p>

		<p>The groups became more compact, and
		talked animatedly. Old friends found each
		other; they shook hands, and, in view of the
		circumstances, smiled cordially, while the
		women saluted each other through their
		veils.</p>

		<p>In passing, we could catch fragments of
		conversation like this:</p>

		<p>&#8220;When will the affair begin?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Were you at the opening of the Variétès
		yesterday?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Theatrical terms were heard&#8212;&#8220;My talents,&#8221;
		&#8220;My charms,&#8221; &#8220;My physique.&#8221; Some
		business, even, was done. A new manager
		was quite surrounded; an old actress organized
		her benefit.</p>

		<p>Suddenly there was a movement in the
		crowd. The undertaker&#8217;s men had just
		placed the coffin in the hearse, and the
		young girls of the Sisterhood of the Virgin,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>85</span>to which the dead girl had belonged, arranged
		themselves in two lines, in their
		white veils, at the sides of the funeral-car.
		Preceded by the master of ceremonies, in
		silk stockings and a wand of office in his
		hand, the poor father appeared on the pavement
		in full mourning, with a white cravat,
		broken down by grief and sustained by his
		friends.</p>

		<p>The procession set out and came to the
		parish church, fortunately near.</p>

		<p>There was a grand mass, with music which
		was not finished. It was too warm in the
		church stuffed with people, and the inattention
		was general. Men who recognized each
		other saluted with a light movement of the
		head; conversation was exchanged in a low
		voice; some young actors struck attitudes
		for the benefit of the women, and the pious
		responded to Dominus Vobiscum droned by
		the priest. At the elevation, from behind the
		altar, rang out a magnificent Pié Jesu, sung
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>86</span>by a celebrated baritone, who had never
		put in his voice so much amorous languor.
		Outside the church-yard the small boys of
		the quarter stood on tiptoe, and, hanging on
		to the railings, pointed out the celebrities
		with their fingers.</p>

		<p>The office finished, the long defile commenced;
		and every one went to the entrance
		of the church to sprinkle some drops of holy-water
		on the bier, and press the hand of the
		old actor, who, broken by grief, and having
		hardly strength to hold his hat, leaned against
		a pillar.</p>

		<p>That was the most horrible moment.</p>

		<p>Carried away by the habit of playing up
		to the situation, all these theatrical people
		put into the token of sympathy which they
		gave to their friend the character of their
		employment. The star advanced gravely, and
		with a three-quarter inclination of his head
		flashed out the &#8220;Look of Fate.&#8221; The old
		tragedian with a gray beard assumed a stoical
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>87</span>expression, and did not forget to &#8220;vibrate&#8221;
		in pronouncing a masculine &#8220;Courage!&#8221;
		The clown approached with a short,
		trotting step, and shaking his head until his
		cheeks trembled, he murmured, &#8220;My poor
		old fellow.&#8221; And the fairy queen, with the
		sensibility of a sensitive female, threw herself
		impulsively on the neck of the unhappy father,
		who, with swollen face, bloodshot eyes,
		and hanging lip, blackened his face and his
		gloved hands with the dye of his mustache,
		diluted by tears.</p>

		<p>And all the time, a few steps from this
		grotesque and sinister scene, we could see&#8212;last
		word of this antithesis&#8212;the white figures
		of the young girls of the sisterhood,
		kneeling on the chairs nearest the coffin of
		their companion, and who undoubtedly were
		beseeching God, in their naïve and original
		prayers, to grant her the paradise of their
		dreams: a pretty paradise in the Jesuitical
		style, all in carved and gilded wood, and
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name="page88"></a>88</span>many-colored marble, where one could see
		at the end a tableau in a transparent light;
		the Virgin crowned with stars, with a serpent
		under her feet, while little cherubs suspended
		in mid-air over her head an azure streamer
		flaming with these words: &#8220;<i>Ecce Regina
		Angelorum</i>.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He was scarcely ten years old when he
		was first arrested as a vagabond.</p>

		<p>He spoke thus to the judge:</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am called Jean François Leturc, and
		for six months I was with the man who
		sings and plays upon a cord of catgut between
		the lanterns at the Place de la Bastille.
		I sang the refrain with him, and after
		that I called, &#8216;Here&#8217;s all the new songs, ten
		centimes, two sous!&#8217; He was always drunk,
		and used to beat me. That is why the police
		picked me up the other night. Before
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>92</span>that I was with the man who sells brushes.
		My mother was a laundress; her name was
		Adéle. At one time she lived with a man on
		the ground-floor at Montmartre. She was a
		good work-woman and liked me. She made
		money because she had for customers waiters
		in the cafés, and they use a good deal of
		linen. On Sundays she used to put me to
		bed early so that she could go to the ball.
		On week-days she sent me to Les Fréres,
		where I learned to read. Well, the sergeant-de-ville
		whose beat was in our street used
		always to stop before our windows to talk
		with her&#8212;a good-looking chap, with a medal
		from the Crimea. They were married,
		and after that everything went wrong. He
		didn&#8217;t take to me, and turned mother against
		me. Every one had a blow for me, and so,
		to get out of the house, I spent whole
		days in the Place Clichy, where I knew the
		mountebanks. My father-in-law lost his
		place, and my mother her work. She used
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page93" name="page93"></a>93</span>to go out washing to take care of him; this
		gave her a cough&#8212;the steam&#8230;. She is
		dead at Lamboisière. She was a good woman.
		Since that I have lived with the seller
		of brushes and the catgut scraper. Are you
		going to send me to prison?&#8221;</p>

		<p>He said this openly, cynically, like a man.
		He was a little ragged street-arab, as tall as
		a boot, his forehead hidden under a queer
		mop of yellow hair.</p>

		<p>Nobody claimed him, and they sent him
		to the Reform School.</p>

		<p>Not very intelligent, idle, clumsy with his
		hands, the only trade he could learn there
		was not a good one&#8212;that of reseating straw
		chairs. However, he was obedient, naturally
		quiet and silent, and he did not seem to be
		profoundly corrupted by that school of vice.
		But when, in his seventeenth year, he was
		thrown out again on the streets of Paris, he
		unhappily found there his prison comrades,
		all great scamps, exercising their dirty professions:
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>94</span>teaching dogs to catch rats in the
		the sewers, and blacking shoes on ball nights
		in the passage of the Opera&#8212;amateur wrestlers,
		who permitted themselves to be thrown
		by the Hercules of the booths&#8212;or fishing at
		noontime from rafts; all of these occupations
		he followed to some extent, and, some
		months after he came out of the house of
		correction, he was arrested again for a petty
		theft&#8212;a pair of old shoes prigged from a
		shop-window. Result: a year in the prison
		of Sainte Pélagie, where he served as valet
		to the political prisoners.</p>

		<p>He lived in much surprise among this
		group of prisoners, all very young, negligent
		in dress, who talked in loud voices, and carried
		their heads in a very solemn fashion.
		They used to meet in the cell of one of the
		oldest of them, a fellow of some thirty years,
		already a long time in prison and quite a
		fixture at Sainte Pélagie&#8212;a large cell, the
		walls covered with colored caricatures, and
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name="page95"></a>95</span>from the window of which one could see all
		Paris&#8212;its roofs, its spires, and its domes&#8212;and
		far away the distant line of hills, blue and
		indistinct upon the sky. There were upon the
		walls some shelves filled with volumes and
		all the old paraphernalia of a fencing-room:
		broken masks, rusty foils, breast-plates, and
		gloves that were losing their tow. It was
		there that the &#8220;politicians&#8221; used to dine together,
		adding to the everlasting &#8220;soup and
		beef,&#8221; fruit, cheese, and pints of wine which
		Jean François went out and got by the can&#8212;a
		tumultuous repast interrupted by violent
		disputes, and where, during the dessert, the
		&#8220;Carmagnole&#8221; and &#8220;Ca Ira&#8221; were sung in
		full chorus. They assumed, however, an air
		of great dignity on those days when a newcomer
		was brought in among them, at first
		entertaining him gravely as a citizen, but on
		the morrow using him with affectionate familiarity,
		and calling him by his nickname.
		Great words were used there: Corporation,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name="page96"></a>96</span>Responsibility, and phrases quite unintelligible
		to Jean François&#8212;such as this, for example,
		which he once heard imperiously put
		forth by a frightful little hunchback who
		blotted some writing-paper every night:</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is done. This is the composition of
		the Cabinet: Raymond, the Bureau of Public
		Instruction; Martial, the Interior; and
		for Foreign Affairs, myself.&#8221;</p>

		<p>His time done, he wandered again around
		Paris, watched afar by the police, after the
		fashion of cockchafers, made by cruel children
		to fly at the end of a string. He became
		one of those fugitive and timid beings
		whom the law, with a sort of coquetry, arrests
		and releases by turn&#8212;something like
		those platonic fishers who, in order that they
		may not exhaust their fish-pond, throw immediately
		back in the water the fish which
		has just come out of the net. Without a
		suspicion on his part that so much honor
		had been done to so sorry a subject, he had
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page97" name="page97"></a>97</span>a special bundle of memoranda in the mysterious
		portfolios of the Rue de Jérusalem.
		His name was written in round hand on the
		gray paper of the cover, and the notes and
		reports, carefully classified, gave him his
		successive appellations: &#8220;Name, Leturc;&#8221;
		&#8220;the prisoner Leturc,&#8221; and, at last, &#8220;the criminal
		Leturc.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He was two years out of prison, dining
		where he could, sleeping in night lodging-houses
		and sometimes in lime-kilns, and taking
		part with his fellows in interminable
		games of pitch-penny on the boulevards
		near the barriers: He wore a greasy cap
		on the back of his head, carpet slippers, and
		a short white blouse. When he had five
		sous he had his hair curled. He danced
		at Constant&#8217;s at Montparnasse; bought for
		two sous to sell for four at the door of
		Bobino, the jack of hearts or the ace of
		clubs serving as a countermark; sometimes
		opened the door of a carriage; led horses
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page98" name="page98"></a>98</span>to the horse-market. From the lottery of
		all sorts of miserable employments he drew
		a goodly number. Who can say if the atmosphere
		of honor which one breathes as a
		soldier, if military discipline might not have
		saved him. Taken, in a cast of the net, with
		some young loafers who robbed drunkards
		sleeping on the streets, he denied very earnestly
		having taken part in their expeditions.
		Perhaps he told the truth, but his antecedents
		were accepted in lieu of proof, and he
		was sent for three years to Poissy. There
		he made coarse playthings for children, was
		tattooed on the chest, learned thieves&#8217; slang
		and the penal-code. A new liberation, and
		a new plunge into the sink of Paris; but
		very short this time, for at the end of six
		months at the most he was again compromised
		in a night robbery, aggravated by
		climbing and breaking&#8212;a serious affair, in
		which he played an obscure role, half dupe
		and half fence. On the whole his complicity
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name="page99"></a>99</span>was evident, and he was sent for five years
		at hard labor. His grief in this adventure
		was above all in being separated from an
		old dog which he had found on a dung-heap,
		and cured of the mange. The beast loved
		him.</p>

		<p>Toulon, the ball and chain, the work in
		the harbor, the blows from a stick, wooden
		shoes on bare feet, soup of black beans dating
		from Trafalgar, no tobacco money, and
		the terrible sleep in a camp swarming with
		convicts; that was what he experienced for
		five broiling summers and five winters raw
		with the Mediterranean wind. He came
		out from there stunned, was sent under surveillance
		to Vernon, where he worked some
		time on the river. Then, an incorrigible
		vagabond, he broke his exile and came again
		to Paris. He had his savings, fifty-six francs,
		that is to say, time enough for reflection.
		During his absence his former wretched
		companions had dispersed. He was well
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>100</span>hidden, and slept in a loft at an old woman&#8217;s,
		to whom he represented himself as a
		sailor, tired of the sea, who had lost his papers
		in a recent shipwreck, and who wanted
		to try his hand at something
		else. <img class="figleft" src="images/fig113.jpg" alt="A man stands on some steps, and peers in a window." /> His tanned
		face and his calloused
		hands, together with some
		sea phrases which he dropped
		from time to time,
		made his tale seem probable
		enough.</p>

		<p>One day when he risked
		a saunter in the streets,
		and when chance had led
		him as far as Montmartre,
		where he was born, an unexpected
		memory stopped him before the
		door of Les Frères, where he had learned to
		read. As it was very warm the door was
		open, and by a single glance the passing outcast
		was able to recognize the peaceable
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>101</span>school-room. Nothing was changed: neither
		the bright light shining in at the great
		windows, nor the crucifix over the desk, nor
		the rows of benches with the tables furnished
		with ink-stands and pencils, nor the
		table of weights and measures, nor the map
		where pins stuck in still indicated the operations
		of some ancient war. Heedlessly and
		without thinking, Jean François read on the
		blackboard the words of the Evangelist
		which had been set there as a copy:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner
		that repenteth, more than over ninety and
		nine just persons, which need no repentance.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It was undoubtedly the hour for recreation,
		for the Brother Professor had left his
		chair, and, sitting on the edge of a table, he
		was telling a story to the boys who surrounded
		him with eager and attentive eyes.
		What a bright and innocent face he had, that
		beardless young man, in his long black
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>102</span>gown, and white necktie, and great ugly
		shoes, and his badly cut brown hair streaming
		out behind! All the simple figures of
		the children of the people who were watching
		him seemed scarcely less childlike than
		his; above all when, delighted with some of
		his own simple and priestly pleasantries, he
		broke out in an open and frank peal of
		laughter which showed his white and regular
		teeth, a peal so contagious that all the
		scholars laughed loudly in their turn. It
		was such a sweet, simple group in the bright
		sunlight, which lighted their dear eyes and
		their blond curls.</p>

		<p>Jean François looked at them for some
		time in silence, and for the first time in that
		savage nature, all instinct and appetite, there
		awoke a mysterious, a tender emotion. His
		heart, that seared and hardened heart, unmoved
		when the convict&#8217;s cudgel or the
		heavy whip of the watchman fell on his
		shoulders, beat oppressively. In that sight
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>103</span>he saw again his infancy; and closing his
		eyes sadly, the prey to torturing regret, he
		walked quickly away.</p>

		<p>Then the words written on the blackboard
		came back to his mind.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t too late, after all!&#8221; he murmured;
		&#8220;if I could again, like others, eat
		honestly my brown bread, and sleep my fill
		without nightmare! The spy must be sharp
		who recognizes me. My beard, which I
		shaved off down there, has grown out thick
		and strong. One can burrow somewhere in
		the great ant-hill, and work can be found.
		Whoever is not worked to death in the hell
		of the galleys comes out agile and robust,
		and I learned there to climb ropes with loads
		upon my back. Building is going on everywhere
		here, and the masons need helpers.
		Three francs a day! I never earned so
		much. Let me be forgotten, and that is all
		I ask.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He followed his courageous resolution; he
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>104</span>was faithful to it, and after three months he
		was another man. The master for whom he
		worked called him his best workman. After
		a long day upon the scaffolding, in the hot
		sun and the dust, constantly bending and
		raising his back to take the hod from the
		man at his feet and pass it to the man over
		his head, he went for his soup to the cook-shop,
		tired out, his legs aching, his hands
		burning, his eyelids stuck with plaster, but
		content with himself, and carrying his well-earned
		money in a knot in his handkerchief.
		He went out now without fear, since he
		could not be recognized in his white mask,
		and since he had noticed that the suspicious
		glances of the policeman were seldom turned
		on the tired workman. He was quiet and
		sober. He slept the sound sleep of fatigue.
		He was free!</p>

		<p>At last&#8212;oh, supreme recompense!&#8212;he
		had a friend!</p>

		<p>He was a fellow-workman like himself,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>105</span>named Savinien, a little peasant with red
		lips who had come to Paris with his stick
		over his shoulder and a bundle on the end
		of it, fleeing from the wine-shops and going
		to mass every Sunday. Jean François loved
		him for his piety, for his candor, for his honesty,
		for all that he himself had lost, and so
		long ago. It was a passion, profound and
		unrestrained, which transformed him by fatherly
		cares and attentions. Savinien, himself
		of a weak and egotistical nature, let
		things take their course, satisfied only in
		finding a companion who shared his horror
		of the wine-shop. The two friends lived together
		in a fairly comfortable lodging, but
		their resources were very limited. They were
		obliged to take into their room a third companion,
		an old Auvergnat, gloomy and rapacious,
		who found it possible out of his
		meagre salary to save something with which
		to buy a place in his own country. Jean
		François and Savinien were always together.
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>106</span>On holidays they together took long walks
		in the environs of Paris, and dined under
		an arbor in one of those small country
		inns where there are a great many mushrooms
		in the sauces and innocent rebusses
		on the napkins. There Jean François learned
		from his friend all that lore of which they
		who are born in the city are ignorant:
		learned the names of the trees, the flowers,
		and the plants; the various seasons for harvesting;
		he heard eagerly the thousand details
		of a laborious country life&#8212;the autumn
		sowing, the winter chores, the splendid celebrations
		of harvest and vintage days, the
		sound of the mills at the water-side, and the
		flails striking the ground, the tired horses
		led to water, and the hunting in the morning
		mist; and, above all, the long evenings
		around the fire of vine-shoots, that were
		shortened by some marvellous stories. He
		discovered in himself a source of imagination
		before unknown, and found a singular
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>107</span>delight in the recital of events so placid, so
		calm, so monotonous.</p>

		<p>One thing troubled him, however: it was
		the fear lest Savinien might learn something
		of his past. Sometimes there escaped from
		him some low word of thieves&#8217; slang, a vulgar
		gesture&#8212;vestiges of his former horrible
		existence&#8212;and he felt the pain one feels
		when old wounds re-open; the more because
		he fancied that he sometimes saw in Savinien
		the awakening of an unhealthy curiosity.
		When the young man, already tempted by
		the pleasures which Paris offers to the poorest,
		asked him about the mysteries of the
		great city, Jean François feigned ignorance
		and turned the subject; but he felt a vague
		inquietude for the future of his friend.</p>

		<p>His uneasiness was not without foundation.
		Savinien could not long remain the
		simple rustic that he was on his arrival in
		Paris. If the gross and noisy pleasures of
		the wine-shop always repelled him, he was
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>108</span>profoundly troubled by other temptations, full
		of danger for the inexperience of his twenty
		years. When spring came he began to go
		off alone, and at first he wandered about
		the brilliant entrance of some dancing-hall,
		watching the young girls who went in with
		their arms around each others&#8217; waists, talking
		in low tones. Then, one evening, when
		lilacs perfumed the air and the call to quadrilles
		was most captivating, he crossed the
		threshold, and from that time Jean François
		observed a change, little by little, in his
		manners and his visage. He became more
		frivolous, more extravagant. He often borrowed
		from his friend his scanty savings,
		and he forgot to repay. Jean François, feeling
		that he was abandoned, jealous and forgiving
		at the same time, suffered and was
		silent. He felt that he had no right to reproach
		him, but with the foresight of affection
		he indulged in cruel and inevitable
		presentiments.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>109</span>One evening, as he was mounting the
		stairs to his room, absorbed in his thoughts,
		he heard, as he was about to enter, the sound
		of angry voices, and he recognized that of
		the old Auvergnat who lodged with Savinien
		and himself. An old habit of suspicion made
		him stop at the landing-place and listen to
		learn the cause of the trouble.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Auvergnat, angrily, &#8220;I am
		sure that some one has opened my trunk
		and stolen from it the three louis that I
		had hidden in a little box; and he who has
		done this thing must be one of the two
		companions who sleep here, if it were not
		the servant Maria. It concerns you as much
		as it does me, since you are the master of
		the house, and I will drag you to the courts
		if you do not let me at once break open the
		valises of the two masons. My poor gold!
		It was here yesterday in its place, and I will
		tell you just what it was, so that if we find
		it again nobody can accuse me of having
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>110</span>lied. Ah, I know them, my three beautiful
		gold pieces, and I can see them as plainly
		as I see you! One piece was more worn
		than the others; it was of greenish gold,
		with a portrait of the great emperor. The
		other was a great old fellow with a queue
		and epaulettes; and the third, which had
		on it a Philippe with whiskers, I had marked
		with my teeth. They don&#8217;t trick me. Do
		you know that I only wanted two more like
		that to pay for my vineyard? Come, search
		these fellows&#8217; things with me, or I will call
		the police! Hurry up!&#8221;
		&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the voice of the landlord;
		&#8220;we will go and search with Maria. So
		much the worse for you if we
		find nothing, and the masons
		get angry. You have forced
		me to it.&#8221;</p>

		<p><img class="figleft" src="images/fig123.jpg" alt="A man leans near a door." />Jean François&#8217; soul
		was full of fright. He
		remembered the embarrassed
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>111</span>circumstances and the small loans
		of Savinien, and how sober he had seemed
		for some days. And yet he could not believe
		that he was a thief. He heard the
		Auvergnat panting in his eager search, and
		he pressed his closed fists against his breast
		as if to still the furious beating of his
		heart.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Here they are!&#8221; suddenly shouted the
		victorious miser. &#8220;Here they are, my louis,
		my dear treasure; and in the Sunday vest
		of that little hypocrite of Limousin! Look,
		landlord, they are just as I told you. Here
		is the Napoleon, the man with a queue, and
		the Philippe that I have bitten. See the
		dents? Ah, the little beggar with the sanctified
		air. I should have much sooner suspected
		the other. Ah, the wretch! Well, he
		must go to the convict prison.&#8221;</p>

		<p>At this moment Jean François heard the
		well-known step of Savinien coming slowly
		up the stairs.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>112</span>He is going to his destruction, thought he.
		Three stories. I have time!</p>

		<p>And, pushing open the door, he entered
		the room, pale as death, where he saw the
		landlord and the servant stupefied in a corner,
		while the Auvergnat, on his knees, in the
		disordered heap of clothes, was kissing the
		pieces of gold.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Enough of this,&#8221; he said, in a thick voice;
		&#8220;I took the money, and put it in my comrade&#8217;s
		trunk. But that is too bad. I am a
		thief, but not a Judas. Call the police; I
		will not try to escape, only I must say a
		word to Savinien in private. Here he is.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In fact, the little Limousin had just arrived,
		and seeing his crime discovered, believing
		himself lost, he stood there, his eyes
		fixed, his arms hanging.</p>

		<p>Jean François seized him forcibly by the
		neck, as if to embrace him; he put his mouth
		close to Savinien&#8217;s ear, and said to him in a
		low, supplicating voice,</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>113</span>&#8220;Keep quiet.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Then turning towards the others:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Leave me alone with him. I tell you I
		won&#8217;t go away. Lock us in if you wish, but
		leave us alone.&#8221;</p>

		<p>With a commanding gesture he showed
		them the door.</p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<img src="images/fig126.jpg" alt="A seated man leans over his knees, while another man confronts him." />
		</div>

		<p class="continued">They went out.</p>

		<p>Savinien, broken by grief, was sitting on
		the bed, and lowered his eyes without understanding
		anything.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>114</span>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Jean François, who came
		and took him by the hands. &#8220;I understand!
		You have stolen three gold pieces to buy
		some trifle for a girl. That costs six months
		in prison. But one only comes out from
		there to go back again, and you will become
		a pillar of police courts and tribunals. I
		understand it. I have been seven years at
		the Reform School, a year at Sainte Pélagie,
		three years at Poissy, five years at Toulon.
		Now, don&#8217;t be afraid. Everything is arranged.
		I have taken it on my shoulders.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is dreadful,&#8221; said Savinien; but hope
		was springing up again in his cowardly heart.</p>

		<p>&#8220;When the elder brother is under the
		flag, the younger one does not go,&#8221; replied
		Jean François. &#8220;I am your substitute, that&#8217;s
		all. You care for me a little, do you not?
		I am paid. Don&#8217;t be childish&#8212;don&#8217;t refuse.
		They would have taken me again one of
		these days, for I am a runaway from exile.
		And then, do you see, that life will be less
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>115</span>hard for me than for you. I know it all,
		and I shall not complain if I have not done
		you this service for nothing, and if you swear
		to me that you will never do it again. Savinien,
		I have loved you well, and your friendship
		has made me happy. It is through it
		that, since I have known you, I have been
		honest and pure, as I might always have
		been, perhaps, if I had had, like you, a father
		to put a tool in my hands, a mother to teach
		me my prayers. It was my sole regret that
		I was useless to you, and that I deceived
		you concerning myself. To-day I have unmasked
		in saving you. It is all right. Do
		not cry, and embrace me, for already I hear
		heavy boots on the stairs. They are coming
		with the <i>posse</i>, and we must not seem
		to know each other so well before those
		chaps.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He pressed Savinien quickly to his breast,
		then pushed him from him, when the door
		was thrown wide open.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>116</span>It was the landlord and the Auvergnat,
		who brought the police. Jean François
		sprang forward to the landing-place, held
		out his hands for the handcuffs, and said,
		laughing, &#8220;Forward, bad lot!&#8221;</p>

		<p>To-day he is at Cayenne, condemned for
		life as an incorrigible.</p>

		<p>When the <i>maître d&#8217;hôtel</i>&#8212;oh, what a respectable
		paunch in an ample kerseymere
		vest! What a worthy and red face, well
		framed by white whiskers! (an English physique,
		I assure you)&#8212;when the imposing
		<i>maître d&#8217;hôtel</i> opened with two raps the door
		of the salon, and announced in his musical
		bass voice, at the same time sonorous and
		respectful, &#8220;The dinner of madame la comtesse
		is served,&#8221; hats were hung on the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>120</span>corners of brackets, while the more distinguished
		of the guests offered their arms to
		the ladies, and all passed into the dining-room,
		silent, almost meditative, like a procession.</p>

		<p>The table glittered. What flowers! What
		lights! Each guest found his place without
		difficulty. As soon as he had read his name
		on the glazed card, a grand lackey in silk
		stockings pushed gently behind him a luxurious
		chair embroidered with a count&#8217;s coronet.
		Fourteen at the table, not more: four
		young women in full toilets, and ten men
		belonging to the aristocracy of blood or of
		merit, who had put on that evening all their
		orders in honor of a foreign diplomat sitting
		at the right hand of the mistress of the
		house. Clusters of jewelled decorations
		hung from button-holes, plaques of diamonds
		glittered in the lapel of one or two black
		coats, a heavy commander&#8217;s cross sparkled
		on the starched front of a general with a
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>121</span>red cravat. As to the ladies, they bore all
		the splendors of their jewel-boxes.</p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<img src="images/fig134.jpg" alt="A bewhiskered man stands in front of a folding screen." />
		</div>

		<p>An elegant and exquisite reunion! What
		an atmosphere of good-living in the high
		hall&#8212;splendidly decorated and ornamented
		on its four panels with studies for a dining-hall
		in the fine style of olden days&#8212;where
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>122</span>were fruits, venison, and eatables of all sorts.
		The service of the table was noiseless; the
		domestics seemed to glide upon the thick
		carpet. The butler whispered the wines in
		the ears of the guests with a confidential
		tone, and as if he were revealing a secret
		upon which life depended.</p>

		<p>At the soup&#8212;a <i>consommé</i> at the same
		time mild and stimulating, giving force and
		youthful vigor to the digestion&#8212;chat between
		neighbors began. Undoubtedly these
		were the merest trifles that were at first so
		low spoken. But what politeness in the
		grave gestures! What affability in looks
		and smiles! Soon after the Chateâu-yquem,
		wit sparkled. These men, for the most part
		old or very mature, all remarkable through
		birth or through talent, had lived much; full
		of experience and memories, they were made
		for conversation, and the beauty of the women
		present inspired them with a desire to
		shine, and excited them to a courteous rivalry.
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>123</span>There was a snapping of bright words,
		a flight of sudden sallies, and the conversationalists
		broke into groups of two or three.
		A famous voyager with bronzed skin, recently
		returned from the farthest deserts, told his
		two neighbors of an elephant hunt, without
		any boasting, with as much tranquillity as
		though he were speaking of shooting rabbits.
		Farther off, the fine profile and white hair of
		an illustrious savant was gallantly inclined
		towards the comtesse, who listened to him
		laughing&#8212;a very slender blonde, her eyes
		young and intent, with a collar of splendid
		emeralds on a bosom like a professional
		beauty, and the neck and shoulders of the
		Venus de Medici.</p>

		<p class="after_thought_break">Decidedly the dinner promised to be
		charming as well as sumptuous. Ennui,
		that too frequent guest at mundane feasts,
		would not come to sit at that table. These
		fortunate ones were going to pass a delicious
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>124</span>hour, drinking enjoyment through every
		pore, by every sense.</p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<img src="images/fig137.jpg" alt="A woman and man converse at table; a second man looks thoughtfully at his plate." />
		</div>

		<p>Now, at that same table, at the lower end,
		in the most modest place, a man still young,
		the least qualified, the most obscure of all
		who were there, a man of reverie and imagination,
		one of those dreamers in whom is
		something of philosophy, something of poetry,
		sat silent.</p>

		<p>Admitted into that high society by virtue
		of his renown as an artist, one of nature&#8217;s
		aristocrats but without vanity, sprung from
		the people and not forgetting it, he breathed
		voluptuously that flower of civilization which
		is called good company.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>125</span>He knew&#8212;none better than he&#8212;how everything
		in this environment&#8212;the charm of
		the women, the wit of the men, the glittering
		table, the furnishing of the hall, to the
		exquisite wine which he had just touched
		to his lips&#8212;how everything was choice and
		rare, and he rejoiced that a concourse of
		things so lovely and so harmonious existed.
		He was plunged in a bath of optimism; it
		seemed to him good that there should be,
		sometimes and somewhere in the weary
		world, beings almost happy. Provided that
		they were accessible to pity, charitable&#8212;and
		these happy people probably were that&#8212;who
		could distress them? what could injure
		them? Ah, beautiful and consoling chimera
		to believe that for such as these life is
		pleasant; that they retain always&#8212;or almost
		always&#8212;that gay, happy light in the
		eye, that half-blossomed smile upon the
		lips; that they have blotted out, as far
		as possible, from their existence, imperious
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>126</span>and discreditable desires and abject infirmities.</p>

		<p>He whom we will call the Dreamer was
		pursuing that train of thought, when the
		<i>maître d&#8217;hôtel</i>&#8212;the superb <i>maître d&#8217;hôtel</i>&#8212;entered
		with solemnity, carrying in a great silver
		plate a turbot of fabulous dimensions&#8212;one
		of those phenomenal fish which are only
		seen in the old paintings representing the
		miraculous draught of fish, or perhaps in
		the window of Chevet, before a row of astonished
		street-boys who flatten their noses
		against the glass window.</p>

		<p class="post_thought_break">Dinner is served. But when the Dreamer
		had before him on his plate a portion of
		the monstrous turbot, the light odor of the
		sea evoked in his mind, prone to unexpected
		suggestions, that corner of Breton, that poor
		village of sailors, where he had been belated
		the other autumn until the equinox, and
		where he had rendered assistance in some
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>127</span>dreadful storms. He suddenly called to
		mind that terrible night when the fishing-boats
		could not come back to port, the night
		that he had passed on the mole amid a
		group of frightened women, standing where
		the sea-spray streamed down his face, and
		the cold and furious wind seemed striving
		to tear his clothes from his back. What
		a life was theirs, those poor men! Down
		there how many widows, young and old,
		wearing always the black shawl, went at
		break of day, with their swarms of children,
		to earn their bread&#8212;oh, nothing but
		bread!&#8212;working in the sickening smell of
		hot oil in the sardine factories! He saw
		again in memory the church above the village,
		half-way up the cliff, the steeple painted
		white to show to the distant boats the
		passage between the reefs; and he saw,
		also, in the short grass of the cemetery
		nibbled by the sheep, the gravestones on
		which this sinister inscription was so often
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>128</span>repeated: &#8220;<i>Lost at sea.</i>&#8221; &#8220;<i>Lost at sea.</i>&#8221; &#8220;<i>Lost
		at sea.</i>&#8221;</p>

		<p>The enormous turbot was of savory and
		delicate taste, and the shrimp sauce with
		which it was served proved that the <i>chef</i> of
		the comte had followed a course in cooking
		at the Café Anglais and profited by it.
		For our refined civilization reaches even this
		point. One takes degrees in culinary science.
		There are doctors in roasts and bachelors
		in sauces. All of the guests eat as if
		they appreciated, and with delicate gestures,
		but without showing special favor for exceptional
		dishes, through good form and because
		they were habituated to exquisite food.</p>

		<p class="post_thought_break">The Dreamer himself had no appetite.
		He was still in thought with the Bretons,
		with the sons of the sea, who had caught, perhaps,
		this magnificent turbot. He remembered
		the day that followed the tempest&#8212;that
		morning, rainy and gray&#8212;when, walking by
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>129</span>the heavy, leaden sea, he had found a body
		at his feet and recognized it as that of an old
		sailor, the father of a family, who had been
		lost at sea three days before&#8212;mournful jetsam,
		stranded in the wrack and foam, so
		heart-rending to see, with the gray hair of
		the drowned full of sand and shells!</p>

		<p>A shudder passed over his heart.</p>

		<p>But the lackeys had already removed the
		plates; every trace of the giant fish had disappeared,
		and while they were serving another
		course, the diners, elegant triflers, had
		taken up their chat again.<img class="figright" src="images/fig142.jpg" alt="A small table with a teapot on it." />
		Hunger being already somewhat
		appeased, they were
		more animated, they spoke
		with more abandon&#8212;light
		laughs ran round. Oh, charming
		and gracious company!</p>

		<p class="post_thought_break">Then the Dreamer, the silent
		guest, was seized with an
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>130</span>infinite sadness; for all the work and distress
		that were required to create this comfort
		and well-being came surging on his
		imagination.</p>

		<p>That these men of the world might wear
		light dress-coats in mid-December, that these
		women might expose their arms and their
		shoulders, the temperature of the room was
		that of a spring morning. And who furnished
		the coal? The poor devils of the
		black country, the subterranean workmen
		who lived in hellish mines. How white and
		fresh is the complexion of that young woman
		against her corsage of pink satin! But
		who had woven that satin? The human
		spider of Lyons, the weaver, always at his
		trade in the leprous houses of the Croix
		Rousse. She wears in her tiny ears two
		beautiful pearls. What brilliancy! what opaline
		transparence! Almost perfect spheres!
		The pearl which Cleopatra dissolved in vinegar
		and swallowed, and which was worth
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>131</span>ten thousand sesterces, was not more pure.
		But does she know, that young woman, that
		in far-off Ceylon, on the pearl-oyster banks
		of Arripo and Condatchy, the Indians of the
		Indian Company plunge heroically down in
		twelve fathoms of water, one foot in the
		heavy stone weight which drags them down
		to the bottom, a knife in the left hand for
		defence against the shark?</p>

		<p class="post_thought_break">But what of that? One is lovely and coquettish.
		The air of the dining-hall is warm
		and perfumed. There one can dine gaily,
		adorned and half nude, flirting with one&#8217;s
		neighbors. What has one to do, I ask you,
		with a dark workman, who digs fifty feet
		under the ground, with a weaver sitting with
		stiffened joints before the loom, with a savage
		who emerges from the sea and sometimes
		reddens it with his blood? Why should one
		think of things so sad, so ugly? What an absurdity!</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>132</span>Meanwhile the Dreamer pursued his train
		of thought.</p>

		<p>An instant ago, without taking thought,
		mechanically he crumbled on the cloth a bit
		of the gilded bread which was placed near
		his napkin. As a viand, a mere bit of fancy,
		insignificant in such a repast, it made him
		think of the <i>naïf</i> phrase of the great lady
		concerning the starving wretches&#8212;&#8220;Let
		them eat cake.&#8221; Nevertheless, this little
		cake is bread all the same&#8212;bread made of
		flour, which in turn is made of wheat. Great
		heaven! yes, it is bread, simply bread, like
		the loaf of the peasant, like the bran-roll of
		the soldier; and that it might be here, on
		the table of the rich, required the patient labor
		of many poor.</p>

		<p>The peasant labored, sowed, reaped. He
		pushed his plough or led his harrow across
		the fertile field, under the cold needles of
		the autumn rain; he started from sleep, full
		of terror for his crop, when it thundered by
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>133</span>night; he trembled, seeing the passage of
		great violet clouds charged with hail; he
		went forth, dissatisfied and gloomy, to the
		heavy work and exhausting labor of harvest.</p>

		<p>And when the old miller, twisted by rheumatism
		which he has caught in the river
		fogs, has sent the flour to Paris, the market-porters
		with the great white hats have carried
		the crushing sacks on their broad backs,
		and last night, even, in the baker&#8217;s cellar the
		workmen toiled until morning.</p>

		<p>Verily, yes! It has cost all these efforts,
		all these pains&#8212;the bit of bread carelessly
		broken by the white hands of these patricians.</p>

		<p>And now the incorrigible Dreamer was
		possessed by these things. The delicacies
		of the repast only recalled to him the suffering
		of humanity. Presently, when the
		butler poured for him a glass of Chambertin,
		did he not remember that certain glass-blowers
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>134</span>became consumptive through blowing
		bottles?</p>

		<p>Let it pass&#8212;it is absurd. He well knows
		that so the world is made. An economist
		would have laughed in his face. Would he
		become a Socialist, perhaps? There will always
		be rich and poor, as there will always
		be well-formed men and hunchbacks.</p>

		<p>Besides, the fortunates before him were
		not unjustly so. These were not vulgar favorites
		of the Gilded Calf&#8212;parvenus gross
		and conceited. The nobleman who presides
		at the table bears with honor and dignity
		a name associated with all the glories
		of France; the general with the gray mustache
		is a hero, and charged at Rezonville
		with the intrepidity of a Murat; the painter,
		the poet, have faithfully served Art and
		Beauty; the chemist, a self-made man who
		began life as a shop-boy in a drug-store, and
		to whom the learned world listens to-day as
		to an oracle, is simply a man of genius;
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>135</span>these high-born dames are generous and
		good, and they will often dip their fair hands
		courageously in the depth of misfortune.
		Why should not these members of the <i>élite</i>
		have exceptional enjoyment?</p>

		<p>The Dreamer said to himself that he had
		been unjust. These were old sophisms&#8212;good,
		at the best, for the clubs of the faubourgs,
		which had been awakened in his
		memory, and by which he had been duped.
		Is it possible? He was ashamed of himself.</p>

		<p>But the dinner neared its end; and while
		the lackeys refilled for the last time the
		champagne-glasses, the table grew silent&#8212;the
		guests felt the apathy of digestion. The
		Dreamer looked at them, one after the other,
		and all the faces had satiated, <i>blasé</i> expressions
		which disturbed and disquieted
		him. A sentiment, obscure, inexplicable, but
		so bitter! protested even from the depth of
		his soul against that repast; and when they
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>136</span>rose at last from the table, he repeated softly
		and stubbornly to himself:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes; they are within their rights. But
		do they know, do they understand, that their
		luxury is made from many miseries? Do
		they think of it sometimes? Do they think
		of it as often as they should? Do they think
		of it?&#8221;</p>

		<h3>I.</h3>

		<p>Saint Medard, the old church of the Rue
		Mouffetard, once well known as the scene of
		the Convulsionnaires, is a very poor parish.
		The &#8220;Faubourg Marceau,&#8221; as they call it
		there, has not much religion, and the vestry-board
		must have hard work to make both
		ends meet. On Sundays, at the hours of
		service, there are but few there, and they are
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>140</span>for the most part women: some twenty of the
		folk of the quarter and some servants in their
		round caps. As for the men, there are not at
		the most more than three or four&#8212;old men
		in peasant jackets, who kneel awkwardly on
		the stone floor, near a pillar, their caps under
		their arms, rolling a great chaplet of
		beads between their fingers, moving their
		lips, and raising their eyes towards the arched
		roof, with an air as if they had given the
		stained-glass windows. On week days, nobody.
		On Thursdays, in the winter, the
		aisles resounded for an instant with the
		clang of wooden shoes, when the students
		of the catechism came and went. Sometimes
		a poor woman, leading one or two
		children and carrying a baby in her arms,
		came to burn a little candle on the stand
		at the chapel of the Virgin, or perhaps one
		heard by the baptismal font the wailing of
		a new-born babe; or, more often, the funeral
		of some poor wretch: a deal box, covered
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>141</span>with a black cloth and resting on two trestles,
		hastily blessed by the priest, before a
		little group of women, the men being free-thinkers,
		and waiting the conclusion of the
		ceremony in the drinking-shop across the
		way, where they played bagatelle for drinks.</p>

		<p>Therefore, the old Abbé Faber, one of the
		vicars of the parish, is sure that twice out of
		three times he will find no penitent before
		his confessional, and has only to hear, for
		the most part of the time, the uninteresting
		confession of some good women. But he is
		conscientious, and on Tuesdays, Thursdays,
		and Saturdays, at seven o&#8217;clock precisely,
		he betakes himself regularly to the chapel
		of St. John, only to make a short prayer and
		return should there be nobody there.</p>



		<h3>II.</h3>

		<p>One day last winter, struggling against a
		heavy wind with his open umbrella, the Abbé
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>142</span>Faber toiled painfully up the Rue Mouffetard,
		on the way to his parish, and, almost
		certain that his toil was useless, he regretted
		to himself the warm fire he had just quitted
		in his little room in the Rue D&#8217;homond, and
		the folio <i>Bollandiste</i> which he had left lying
		on the table, with his eye-glasses on its open
		pages. But it was Saturday night, the day
		when certain old widows, who earned their
		scant income in the neighboring boarding-houses,
		sometimes sought absolution for the
		morrow&#8217;s communion. The honest priest
		could not, therefore, excuse himself from
		entering his oak box and opening, with the
		punctuality of a cashier, that wicket where
		the devotees, for whom the confessional is a
		spiritual savings-bank, make a weekly deposit
		of their venial sins.</p>

		<p>The Abbé Faber was the more sorry to
		go out, because that particular Saturday was
		pay-day, and on such occasions the Rue
		Mouffetard swarmed with people, and a people
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>143</span>not well disposed toward his cloth. However
		good a man one may be, it is far from
		agreeable to be forced to lower the eyes to
		avoid malevolent looks, and to stop the ears
		against insolent words heard in passing.
		There was a certain drinking-shop which the
		abbé particularly dreaded&#8212;a shop brilliant
		with gas and exhaling an odor of alcohol
		through its open doors, through which one
		could see a perspective of barrels labelled:
		&#8220;Absinthe,&#8221; &#8220;Bitter,&#8221; &#8220;Madère,&#8221; &#8220;Vermouth,&#8221;
		etc. Here, leaning against the bar,
		were always a band of loafers in long blouses
		and high hats, who saluted the poor abbé,
		walking quickly along the pavement, with
		ribald jests.</p>

		<p>However, on this night the streets were
		deserted on account of the bad weather, and
		the abbé reached his church without interruption.
		He dipped his finger in the holy
		water, crossed himself, made a brief reverence
		before the grand altar, and went towards
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>144</span>his confessional. At least he had not
		come for nothing. A penitent was waiting.</p>



		<h3>III.</h3>

		<p>A male penitent! a rare and exceptional
		thing at Saint Médard. But, distinguishing
		by the red light of the lamp hanging from
		the roof of the chapel the short white jacket
		and the heavy nailed shoes of the kneeling
		man, the Abbé Faber believed him to be
		some workman who had kept his rustic
		faith and his early habits of religious observance.
		Without doubt the confession that
		he was about to hear would be as stupid as
		that of the cook of the Rue Monge, who, after
		having accused himself of petty thefts, exclaimed
		loudly against a single word of restitution.
		The priest even smiled to himself
		as he remembered the formal confession of
		one of the inhabitants of the faubourg, who
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>145</span>came to ask for a billet of confession that
		he might marry. &#8220;I have neither killed or
		robbed. Ask me about the rest.&#8221; And so
		the vicar entered very tranquilly into his
		confessional, and, after having taken a copious
		pinch of snuff, opened without emotion
		the little curtain of green serge which closed
		the wicket.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Monsieur le curé,&#8221; stammered a rough
		voice, which was making an effort to speak
		low.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am not a curé, my friend. Say your
		<i>confiteor</i>, and call me father.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The man, whose face the abbé could not
		see among the shadows, stumbled through
		the prayer, which he seemed to have great
		difficulty in recalling, and he began again in
		a hoarse whisper:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Monsieur le curé&#8212;no&#8212;my father&#8212;excuse
		me if I do not speak properly, but I
		have not been to confession for twenty-five
		years&#8212;no, not since I quitted the country&#8212;you
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>146</span>know how it is&#8212;a man in Paris, and
		yet I have not been worse than other people,
		and I have said to myself, &#8216;God must
		be a good sort of fellow.&#8217; But to-day what
		I have on my conscience is too heavy to carry
		alone, and you must hear me, monsieur le
		curé: I have killed a man!&#8221;</p>

		<p>The abbé half rose from his seat. A murderer!
		There was no longer any question
		of his mind wandering from the duties of
		his office, of half annoyance at the garrulity
		of the old women, to whom he listened with
		a half attentive ear, and whom he absolved
		in all confidence. A murderer! That head
		which was so near his had conceived and
		planned such a crime! Those hands, crossed
		on the confessional, were perhaps still stained
		with blood! In his trouble, perhaps not unmixed
		with a certain amount of fear, the
		Abbé Faber could only speak mechanically.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Confess yourself, my son. The mercy of
		God is infinite.&#8221;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>147</span>&#8220;Listen to my whole story,&#8221; said the man,
		with a voice trembling with profound grief.
		&#8220;I am a workingman, and I came to Paris
		more than twenty years ago with a fellow-countryman,
		a companion from childhood.
		We robbed birds&#8217;-nests, and we learned to
		read in school together&#8212;almost a brother,
		sir. He was called Philip; I am called Jack,
		myself. He was a fine big fellow; I have always
		been heavy and ill-formed. There was
		never a better workman than he&#8212;while I am
		only a &#8216;botcher&#8217;&#8212;and so generous and good-natured,
		wearing his heart on his sleeve. I
		was proud to be his friend, to walk by his
		side&#8212;proud when he clapped me on the back
		and called me a clumsy fellow. I loved him
		because I admired him, in fact. Once here,
		what an opportunity! We worked together
		for the same employer, but he left me alone
		in the evenings more than half the time.
		He preferred to amuse himself with his companions&#8212;natural
		enough, at his age. He
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>148</span>loved pleasure, he was free, he had no responsibilities.
		All this was impossible for me.
		I was forced to save my money, for at that
		time I had an invalid mother in the country,
		and I sent her all my savings. As for
		me, I stayed at the fruiterer&#8217;s where I lodged,
		and who kept a lodging-house for masons.
		Philip did not dine there; he used to go
		somewhere else, and, to tell the truth, the
		dinners were not particularly good. But the
		fruiterer was a widow, far from happy, and I
		saw that my payments were of help to her;
		and then, to be frank, I fell at once in love
		with her daughter. Poor Catherine! You
		will soon know, monsieur le curé, what came
		from it all. I was there three years without
		daring to tell her of the love I had for her.
		I have told you that I am not a good workman,
		and the little that I gained hardly sufficed
		for me and for the support of my
		mother. There could be no thought of
		marrying. At last my good mother left this
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>149</span>world for a better. I was somewhat less
		pressed for money, and I began to save, and
		when it seemed to me that I had enough
		to begin with, I told Catherine of my love.
		She said nothing at first&#8212;neither yes nor
		no. Well, I knew that no one would fall
		upon my neck; I am not attractive. In the
		mean time Catherine consulted her mother,
		who thought well of me as a steady workman,
		as a good fellow, and the marriage was
		decided upon. Ah, I had some happy weeks!
		I saw that Catherine barely accepted me, and
		that she was by no means carried away with
		me; but as she had a good heart, I hoped
		that she would love me some day&#8212;I would
		make her love me. As a matter of course, I
		told everything to Philip, whom I saw every
		day at the work-yard, and as Catherine and
		I were engaged, I wanted him to meet her.
		Perhaps you have already guessed the end,
		monsieur le curé. Philip was handsome,
		lively, good-tempered&#8212;everything that I
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>150</span>was not; and without attempting it, innocently
		enough, he fascinated Catherine. Ah,
		Catherine had a frank and honest heart, and
		as soon as she recognized what had happened
		she at once told me everything.</p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<img src="images/fig163.jpg" alt="A seated man looks at a woman whose back is turned and head is bowed." />
		</div>

		<p class="continued">Ah, I can never forget that moment! It was
		Catherine&#8217;s birthday, and in honor of it I
		had bought a little cross of gold which I had
		arranged in a box with cotton. We were
		alone in the back shop, and she had just
		brought me my soup. I took my box from
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>151</span>my pocket, and, opening it, I showed her
		the jewel. Then she burst into tears.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;Forgive me, Jack,&#8217; she said, &#8216;and keep
		that for her whom you will marry. As for
		me, I can never become your wife. I love
		another&#8212;I love Philip.&#8217;</p>


		<h3>IV.</h3>

		<p>&#8220;Believe me, I had trouble enough then,
		monsieur le curé; my soul was full of it.
		But what could I do, since I loved them
		both? Only what I believed was for their
		happiness&#8212;let them marry. And as Philip
		had always lived freely, and spent as he
		made, I lent him my hoard to buy the furniture.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Then they were married, and for a while
		all went well. They had a little boy, and I
		stood sponsor for him and named him Camille,
		in remembrance of his mother. It
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>152</span>was a little after the birth of the baby that
		Philip began to go wrong. I was mistaken
		in him&#8212;he was not made for marriage; he
		was too fond of frivolity and pleasure. You
		live in a poor quarter, monsieur le curé, and
		you must know the sad story by heart&#8212;the
		workman who glides little by little from idleness
		into drunkenness, who is off on a spree
		for two or three days, who does not bring
		home his week&#8217;s wages, and who only returns
		to his home, broken up by his spree, to make
		scenes and to beat his wife. In less than
		two years Philip became one of these wretches.
		At first I tried to reform him, and sometimes,
		ashamed of himself, he would attempt
		to do better; but that did not last long.
		Then my remonstrances only irritated him;
		and when I went to his house, and he saw
		me look sadly around the chamber made
		bare by the pawn-shop, at poor Catherine,
		thin and pale with grief, he became furious.
		One day he had the audacity to be jealous
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>153</span>of me on account of his wife, who was as
		pure as the blessed Virgin, reminding me
		that I was once her lover and accusing me
		of still being so, with slanders and infamies
		that I should be ashamed to repeat. We
		almost flew at each other&#8217;s throats. I saw
		what I must do. I would see Catherine and
		my godson no more; and as for Philip, I
		would only meet him when by chance we
		worked on the same job.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Only, you will understand, I loved Catherine
		and little Camille too well to lose sight
		of them entirely. On Saturday evenings,
		when I knew that Philip was drinking up his
		wages with his comrades, I used to prowl
		about the quarter, and chat with the boy
		when I found him; and if it was too miserable
		at home, he did not return with empty
		hands, you know. I believe that the wretched
		Philip knew that I was helping his wife,
		and that he closed his eyes to the fact, finding
		it rather convenient. I will hurry on,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>154</span>for the story is too miserable. Some years
		have passed; Philip plunging deeper in vice;
		but Catherine, whom I had helped all I
		could, has educated her son, who is now a
		fellow of twenty years, good and courageous
		like herself. He is not a workman; he is
		educated; he has learned to draw at the
		evening schools, and he is now with an architect,
		where he gets good wages. And
		though the house is saddened by the presence
		of the drunkard, things go fairly well,
		for Camille is a great comfort to his mother;
		and for a year or two, when I see Catherine&#8212;she
		is so changed, the poor woman!&#8212;leaning
		on the arm of her manly son, it warms
		my heart.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But yesterday evening, coming out of
		my cook-shop, I met Camille; and shaking
		hands with him&#8212;oh, he is not ashamed of
		me, and he doesn&#8217;t blush at a blouse covered
		with plaster&#8212;I saw that something was the
		matter.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>155</span>&#8220;&#8216;Let&#8217;s see&#8212;what&#8217;s the matter now?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;I drew the lot yesterday,&#8217; he replied,
		&#8216;and I drew the number ten&#8212;a number that
		sends you to die with fever in the colonies
		with the marines. That will, at all events,
		send me there for five years, to leave mother
		alone, without resources, with father, who
		has never been drinking so much, who has
		never been so wicked. And it will kill her&#8212;it
		will kill her! How cursed it is to be
		poor!&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Oh, what a horrible night I passed!
		Think of it, monsieur le curé, that poor
		woman&#8217;s labor for twenty years destroyed
		in a minute by an unhappy chance; because
		a child, rummaging in a sack, has drawn an
		unfortunate number! In the morning I was
		broken as by age when I went to the house
		we were building on the Boulevard Arago.
		Of what use is sorrow? we must work all
		the same. So I mounted the scaffolding.
		We had already built the house to the fourth
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>156</span>story, and I began to place my mortar. Suddenly
		I felt some one strike me on the shoulder.
		It was Philip. He only worked now
		when the inclination seized him, and he was
		apparently putting in a day&#8217;s work to get
		something to drink; but the builder, having
		a forfeit to pay if the building was not finished
		by a certain date, accepted the first-comers.</p>



		<h3>V.</h3>

		<p>&#8220;I had not seen Philip for a long time,
		and it was with difficulty that I recognized
		him. Burned and fevered by brandy, his
		beard gray, his hands trembling, he was
		more than an old man&#8212;he was a ruin.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;the boy has drawn
		a bad number.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;What of it?&#8217; he replied, with an angry
		look. &#8216;Are you going to worry me about
		that, too, like Catherine and Camille? The
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>157</span>boy will do as others have done: he will
		serve his country. I know what worries
		them, both my wife and son. If I were dead
		he would not have to go. But, so much the
		worse for them, I am still solid at my post,
		and Camille is not the son of a widow.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The son of a widow! Ah, monsieur le
		curé, why did he use that unhappy phrase?
		The evil thought came to me at once, and it
		never quitted me all the morning that I
		worked at the wretch&#8217;s side. I imagined all
		that she was about to suffer&#8212;poor Catherine!&#8212;when
		she no longer had her son to care for
		and protect her, and she must be alone with
		the miserable drunkard, now completely brutalized,
		ugly, and capable of anything. A
		neighboring clock struck eleven, and the
		workmen all descended to lunch. We remained
		until the last, Philip and I, but in
		stepping on the ladder to descend, he turned
		to me with a leer, and said, in his hoarse,
		dissipated voice:</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>158</span>&#8220;&#8216;You see, steady as a sailor; Camille is
		not nearly the son of a widow.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The blood mounted to my head. I was
		beside myself. I seized with both hands
		the rounds of the ladder to which Philip
		clung shouting &#8216;Help!&#8217; and with a single
		effort I toppled it over.</p>

		<p>&#8220;He was instantly killed&#8212;by an accident,
		they said&#8212;and now Camille is the son of a
		widow and need not go.</p>

		<p>&#8220;That is what I have done, monsieur le
		curé, and what I want to tell to you and to
		the good God. I repent, I ask pardon, of
		course; but I must not see Catherine in her
		black dress, happy on the arm of her son, or
		I could not regret my crime. To prevent
		that I will emigrate&#8212;I will lose myself in
		America. As to my penance&#8212;see, monsieur
		le curé, here is the little cross of gold that
		Catherine refused when she told me that she
		was in love with Philip. I have always kept
		it, in memory of the only happy days that I
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>159</span>ever knew in my life. Take it and sell it.
		Give the money to the poor.&#8221;</p>

		<p class="post_thought_break">Jack rose absolved by the Abbé Faber.</p>

		<p>One thing is certain, and that is that the
		priest never sold the little cross of gold.
		After having paid its price into the Treasury
		of the Church, he hung the jewel, as an <i>ex-voto</i>,
		on the altar of the chapel of the Virgin,
		where he often went to pray for the poor
		mason.</p>

			<img src="images/fig176.jpg" alt="A pair of wooden shoes." title="The Sabots of little Wolff. A Christmas Story." />
		</div>

		<p>Once upon a time&#8212;it was so long ago that
		the whole world has forgotten the date&#8212;in
		a city in the north of Europe&#8212;whose name
		is so difficult to pronounce that nobody remembers
		it&#8212;once upon a time there was a
		little boy of seven, named Wolff, an orphan
		in charge of an old aunt who was hard and
		avaricious, who only embraced him on New-Year&#8217;s
		Day, and who breathed a sigh of regret
		every time that she gave him a porringer
		of soup.</p>

		<p>But the poor little chap was naturally so
		good that he loved the old woman just the
		same, although she frightened him very
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>164</span>much, and he could never see without trembling
		the great wart, ornamented with four
		gray hairs, which she had on the end of her
		nose.</p>

		<p>As the aunt of Wolff was known through
		all the village to have a house and an old
		stocking full of gold, she did not dare send
		her nephew to the school for the poor. But
		she so schemed to obtain a reduction of the
		price with the school-master whose school
		little Wolff attended, that the bad teacher,
		vexed at having a scholar so badly dressed
		and who paid so poorly, punished him very
		often and unjustly with the backboard and
		fool&#8217;s cap, and even stirred his fellow-pupils
		against him, all sons of well-to-do men, who
		made the orphan their scapegoat.</p>

		<p>The poor little fellow was therefore as
		miserable as the stones in the street, and hid
		himself in out-of-the-way corners to cry;
		when Christmas came.</p>

		<p>The night before Christmas the school-master
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>165</span>was to take all of his pupils to the
		midnight mass, and bring them back to their
		homes.</p>

		<p>Now, as the winter was very severe that
		year, and as for several days a great quantity
		of snow had fallen, the scholars came to
		the rendezvous warmly wrapped and bundled
		up, with fur caps pulled down over
		their ears, double and triple jackets, knitted
		gloves and mittens, and good thick nailed
		boots with strong soles. Only little Wolff
		came shivering in the clothes that he wore
		week-days and Sundays, and with nothing
		on his feet but coarse Strasbourg socks and
		heavy sabots, or wooden shoes.</p>

		<p>His thoughtless comrades made a thousand
		jests over his sad looks and his peasant&#8217;s
		dress. But the orphan was so occupied
		in blowing on his fingers, and suffered so
		much from his chilblains, that he took no notice
		of them; and the troop of boys, with the
		master at their head, started for the church.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>166</span><img class="figleft" src="images/fig179.jpg" alt="A little boy blows on his hands." />
		It was fine in the church, which was resplendent
		with wax-candles; and the scholars,
		excited by the pleasant warmth, profited
		by the noise of the organ and the singing to
		talk to each other in a low voice. They
		boasted of the fine suppers that were waiting
		for them at home. The son of the
		burgomaster had seen, before he went out,
		a monstrous goose that the truffles marked
		with black spots like a leopard. At the
		house of the first citizen there was a little
		fir-tree in a wooden box, from whose branches
		hung oranges, sweetmeats, and toys. And
		the cook of the first citizen had pinned behind
		her back the two strings of her cap, as
		she only did on her days of inspiration when
		she was sure of succeeding with her famous
		sugar-candy. And then the scholars spoke,
		too, of what the Christ-child would bring to
		them, of what he would put in their shoes,
		which they would, of course, be very careful
		to leave in the chimney before going to bed.
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>167</span>And the eyes of those little chaps, lively as
		a parcel of mice, sparkled in advance with
		the joy of seeing in their imagination pink
		paper bags of burnt almonds, lead soldiers
		drawn up in battalions in their boxes, menageries
		smelling of varnished wood, and magnificent
		jumping-jacks covered with purple
		and bells.</p>

		<p>Little Wolff knew very well by experience
		that his old miserly aunt would send him
		supperless to bed. But in the simplicity of
		his soul, and knowing that he had been all
		the year as good and industrious as possible,
		he hoped that the Christ-child would not
		forget him, and he, too, looked eagerly forward
		by-and-by to putting his wooden shoes
		in the ashes of the fireplace.</p>

		<p>The midnight mass concluded, the faithful
		went away, anxious for supper, and the
		band of scholars, walking two by two after
		their teacher, left the church.</p>

		<p>Now, under the porch, sitting on a stone
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>168</span>seat under a Gothic niche, a child was sleeping&#8212;a
		child covered by a robe of white linen,
		and whose feet were bare, notwithstanding
		the cold. He was not a beggar, for his robe
		was new and nice, and near him on the
		ground were seen, lying in a cloth, a square,
		a hatchet, a pair of compasses, and the other
		tools of a carpenter&#8217;s apprentice. <img class="figleft" src="images/fig181.jpg" alt="A boy wrapped in cloth, sleeping in a niche. He has a halo and bare feet. A wooden shoe is on the ground before him." />Under
		the light of the stars, his face, with its closed
		eyes, bore an expression of divine sweetness,
		and his long locks of golden
		hair seemed like an <i>auréole</i>
		about his head. But
		the child&#8217;s feet, blue in
		the cold of that December
		night, were sad to see.</p>

		<p>The scholars, so well
		clothed and shod for the
		winter, passed heedlessly
		before the unknown child.
		One of them, even, the son
		of one of the principal
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>169</span>men in the village, looked at the waif with
		an expression in which could be seen all the
		scorn of the rich for the poor, the well-fed
		for the hungry.</p>

		<p>But little Wolff, coming the last out of the
		church, stopped, full of compassion, before
		the beautiful sleeping infant.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Alas!&#8221; said the orphan to himself, &#8220;it is
		too bad: this poor little one going barefoot
		in such bad weather. But what is worse than
		all, he has not to-night even a boot or a wooden
		shoe to leave before him while he sleeps,
		so that the Christ-child could put something
		there to comfort him in his misery.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And, carried away by the goodness of his
		heart, little Wolff took off the wooden shoe
		from his right foot, and laid it in front of
		the sleeping child; and then, as best he
		could, limping along on his poor blistered
		foot and dragging his sock through the
		snow, he went back to his aunt&#8217;s.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Look at the worthless fellow!&#8221; cried his
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>170</span>aunt, full of anger at his return without one
		of his shoes. &#8220;What have you done with
		your wooden shoe, little wretch?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Little Wolff did not know how to deceive,
		and although he was shaking with terror at
		seeing the gray hairs bristle up on the nose
		of the angry woman, he tried to stammer
		out some account of his adventure.</p>

		<p>But the old woman burst into a frightful
		peal of laughter.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ah, monsieur takes off his shoes for
		beggars! Ah, monsieur gives away his wooden
		shoe to a barefoot! That is something
		new for example! Ah, well, since that is so,
		I am going to put the wooden shoe which
		you have left in the chimney, and I promise
		you the Christ-child will leave there to-night
		something to whip you with in the morning.
		And you shall pass the day to-morrow on
		dry bread and water. We will see if next
		time you give away your shoes to the first
		vagabond that comes.&#8221;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>171</span>And the wicked woman, after having given
		the poor boy a couple of slaps, made him
		climb up to his bed in the attic. Grieved
		to the heart, the child went to bed in the
		dark, and soon went to sleep on his pillow
		steeped with tears.</p>

		<p>But on the morrow morning, when the old
		woman, awakened by the cold and shaken
		by her cough, went down stairs&#8212;oh, wonderful
		sight!&#8212;she saw the great chimney full
		of beautiful playthings, and sacks of magnificent
		candies, and all sorts of good things;
		and before all these splendid things the
		right shoe, that her nephew had given to the
		little waif, stood by the side of the left shoe,
		that she herself had put there that very
		night, and where she meant to put a birch-rod.</p>

		<p>And as little Wolff, running down to learn
		the meaning of his aunt&#8217;s exclamation, stood
		in artless ecstasy before all these splendid
		Christmas presents, suddenly there were loud
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>172</span>cries of laughter out-of-doors. The old
		woman and the little boy went out to know
		what it all meant, and saw all the neighbors
		gathered around the public fountain. What
		had happened? Oh, something very amusing
		and very extraordinary. The children
		of all the rich people of the village, those
		whose parents had wished to surprise them
		by the most beautiful gifts, had found only
		rods in their shoes.</p>

		<p>Then the orphan and the old woman,
		thinking of all the beautiful things that were
		in their chimney, were full of amazement.
		But presently they saw the curé coming with
		wonder in his face. Above the seat, placed
		near the door of the church, at the same
		place where in the evening a child, clad in a
		white robe, and with feet bare notwithstanding
		the cold, had rested his sleeping head,
		the priest had just seen a circle of gold incrusted
		with precious stones.</p>

		<p>And they all crossed themselves devoutly,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>173</span>comprehending that the beautiful sleeping
		child, near whom were the carpenter&#8217;s tools,
		was Jesus of Nazareth in person, become
		for an hour such as he was when he worked
		in his parents&#8217; house, and they bowed themselves
		before that miracle that the good
		God had seen fit to work, to reward the
		faith and charity of a child.</p>

		<h3>I.</h3>

		<p>Sitting in her office at the end of the
		shop, shut off from it by glass windows, pretty
		Madame Bayard, in a black gown and
		with her hair in sober braids, was writing
		steadily in an enormous ledger with leather
		corners, while her husband, following his
		morning custom, stopped at the door to
		scold his workmen, who had not finished
		unloading a dray from the Northern Railway,
		which blocked the road, and carried to
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>178</span>the druggist of the Rue
		Vieille du Temple a dozen
		casks of glucose.</p>

		<p><img class="figleft" src="images/fig191.jpg" alt="A woman writes in a large book on an angled desk." />&#8220;I have bad news to
		tell you,&#8221; said Madame
		Bayard, sticking her pen
		in a cup of leaden shot,
		when her husband had
		entered the glass cage.
		&#8220;Poor Voisin is dead.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The nurse of Leon? Poor woman! And
		her little daughter?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;That is the saddest part, my dear. A
		relative of poor Voisin writes me that they
		are too poor to take charge of the child, and
		she must be sent to an orphan asylum.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Oh, those peasants!&#8221;</p>

		<p>The druggist was silent for a moment,
		rubbing his thick blond beard; then suddenly
		looking at his wife with kindly eyes:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Say, Mimi, the child is the foster sister
		of our Leon. Suppose we give her a home?&#8221;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>179</span>&#8220;I should think so,&#8221; was the quiet reply
		of the pretty wife.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Well done,&#8221; cried Bayard, as, caring little
		if he were seen by his clerks and store-boys,
		he leaned towards his wife and kissed
		her forehead, &#8220;well done! you&#8217;re a good
		woman, Mimi. We will take little Norine
		with us, and bring her up with Leon. That
		won&#8217;t ruin us, eh? Besides, I have just made
		a good stroke in quinine. We will go after
		the child Sunday to Argenteuil, sha&#8217;n&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;We will make that our Sunday excursion.&#8221;</p>


		<h3>II.</h3>

		<p>Good people, these Bayards; an honor to
		the drug trade. Their marriage had united
		two houses which had been for a long time
		rivals; for Bayard was the son of <i>The Silver
		Pill</i>, founded by his great-great-grandfather
		in 1756 in the Rue Vieille du Temple,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>180</span>and had espoused the daughter of the <i>Offering
		to Esculapius</i>, of the Rue des Lombards,
		an establishment which dated from the First
		Empire, as was shown by the sign, copied
		from the celebrated painting of Guérin.
		Honest people, excellent people&#8212;and there
		are many more, like them, whatever folks
		may say, among the older Paris houses, conservators
		of old traditions; going to the second
		tier, on Sunday, at the opera comique,
		and ignorant of false weights and measures.
		It was the curé of Blancs-Manteaux who had
		managed that marriage with his confrère of
		Saint-Merry. The first had ministered at
		the death-bed of the elder Bayard, and was
		dismayed to see a young man of twenty-five
		all alone in a house so gloomy as that of <i>The
		Silver Pill</i>, justly famed for its ipecac; and
		the second was anxious to establish Mademoiselle
		Simonin, to whom he had administered
		her first communion, and whose father
		was one of his most important parishioners,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>181</span>old Simonin of the <i>Offering to Esculapius</i>,
		celebrated for its camphor. The negotiations
		were successful; camphor and ipecac,
		two excellent specialties, were united in the
		holy bonds of matrimony, there was a dinner
		and ball at the Grand Véfour, and now for
		ten years, tranquilly working every day, summer
		and winter, in her glass cage, Madame
		Bayard, with her pale brown face and her
		plaited hair, had smitten the hearts of all
		the young clerks of the quarter Sainte-Croix
		de la Bretonnerie.</p>

		<p>And yet for a long time there had been a
		disappointment in that happy household, a
		cloud in that bright sky. An heir was wanted,
		and it was five years before little Leon
		came into the world. One can imagine with
		what joy he was received. Now one day
		they might write over the door of <i>The Silver
		Pill</i> these words, &#8220;Bayard &amp; Son.&#8221; But as
		the infant arrived at the time of a boom in
		isinglass, Madame Bayard, whose presence
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>182</span>in the shop was indispensable, could not
		think of nursing him. She even gave up the
		idea of taking a nurse in the house, fearing
		for the new-born the close air of that corner
		of old Paris, and contented herself with taking
		every Sunday with her husband a little
		excursion to Argenteuil to see her son with
		his nurse Voisin, who was overwhelmed with
		coffee, sugar, soap, and other dainties. At
		the end of eighteen months Mother Voisin
		brought back the baby in a magnificent
		state, and for two years a child&#8217;s nurse,
		chosen with great care, had taken the child
		out for his airings in the square of the Tour
		Saint-Jacques, and had exhibited for the admiration
		of her companion-nurses, the pouting
		lips, the high color, and the dimpled
		back of the future druggist.</p>

		<p>And now these good Bayards, learning of
		the death of Mother Voisin, could not bear
		the thought that the little girl who had been
		nourished at the same breast with their boy
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>183</span>should be abandoned to public charity, so
		they went to Argenteuil for Norine.</p>

		<p>Poor little one! Since the fifteen days
		that her mother slept in the cemetery she had
		been taken charge of by a cousin who kept
		a billiard-saloon; and though she was not
		yet five years old, she had been put to work
		washing the beer-glasses.</p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<img src="images/fig196.jpg" alt="Two men sit drinking at a table." />
		</div>

		<p>The Bayards found her charming, with
		great eyes as blue as the summer sun, and
		her thick blond tresses escaping from her
		ugly black bonnet. Leon, who had been
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>184</span>brought with his nurse, embraced his foster
		sister; and the cousin, who that very morning
		had boxed the orphan&#8217;s ears for negligence
		in sweeping out the hall, appeared
		before the Parisians to be as much touched
		as if parting with Norine was a heart-breaking
		affair.</p>

		<p>The order for an ample breakfast restored
		his serenity.</p>

		<p>It was a beautiful Sunday in June, and
		they were in the country&#8212;&#8220;an occasion
		which should be improved,&#8221; declared Bayard,
		&#8220;by taking the air; shouldn&#8217;t it, Mimi?&#8221;</p>

		<p>And while pretty Madame Bayard, having
		pinned up her skirts, went out with the children
		and the nurse to pick flowers in a neighboring
		field, the druggist, who was less ambitious,
		treated the saloon-keeping cousin
		to a glass of vermouth, seated at the billiard-table,
		which was covered with dead flies.
		They breakfasted under a vineless arbor,
		which the hot noonday sun riddled with its
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>185</span>rays. But what of that? They were pleased
		and contented all the same. Madame Bayard
		had hung her hat on the lattice; and
		her husband, wearing a bargeman&#8217;s straw
		helmet, which had been lent to him by the
		saloon-keeper, cut up the duck in the best
		of spirits. Little Leon and Norine, who
		had immediately become the best of friends,
		emptied the salad-bowl of its cream-cheese. <img class="figright" src="images/fig198.jpg" alt="A woman and a girl in tall grass." />
		Then they all romped in the grass, went
		boating on the stream, and, intoxicated with
		the fresh country air, the
		indwellers of the city,
		coming from the close
		Paris streets, pushed to
		its fullest extreme this
		idyl in the fashion of
		Paul de Kock.</p>

		<p>For, yes; there was a
		moment, as they came
		back in the boat, in a
		delicious sunset, when
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>186</span>tinted clouds floated in a glowing sky, when
		Madame Bayard&#8212;the serious Madame Bayard&#8212;whose
		frown turned to stone the shop-boys
		of the druggist, sang the air called
		&#8220;To the Shores of France,&#8221; to the rhythmic
		fall of the oars, plied by her husband in his
		shirt-sleeves. They dined in the arbor where
		they had breakfasted, but the second repast
		was a shade less happy. The night-moths,
		which dashed in to burn themselves at the
		candles, frightened the children; and Madame
		Bayard was so tired that she could
		not even guess the simple rebus on her dessert
		napkin.</p>

		<p>Never mind; it has been a good day; and
		on their return in a first-class carriage&#8212;this
		was not a time for petty economies&#8212;Madame
		Bayard, with her head on her husband&#8217;s
		shoulder, watching Leon and Norine,
		limp with sleep on the lap of the nurse, half
		asleep herself, murmured to her husband, in
		a happy voice:</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>187</span>&#8220;See, Ferdinand; we have done well to
		take the little one. She will be a comrade
		for Leon. They will be like brother and
		sister.&#8221;</p>



		<h3>III.</h3>

		<p>In fact, they did thus grow up together.</p>

		<p>They were most kind-hearted people, these
		Bayards. They made no difference between
		the humble orphan and their own dear boy,
		who would one day in the firm of &#8220;Bayard
		&amp; Son&#8221; work monopolies in rhubarb and
		corners in castor-oil; indeed, they loved as
		their own child little Norine, who was as intelligent
		as she was charming, as fair in mind
		as she was delicate in body.</p>

		<p>Now the nurse took the two children to
		the square of the Tour Saint-Jacques when
		the weather was pleasant, and in the evening
		at the family table there were two high-chairs
		side by side for the boy and his foster
		sister.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>188</span>In addition to which, the Bayards were
		not slow to perceive the good influence which
		Norine had upon Leon. Quicker, of a more
		nervous temperament, more easy of comprehension
		than the lymphatic boy, whose wits
		were &#8220;wool-gathering,&#8221; according to his father,
		she seemed to communicate to him
		something of her own spirit and fire. &#8220;She
		jogs him up,&#8221; said Madame Bayard.</p>

		<p>And since he had lived with his foster
		sister Leon had perceptibly grown brighter
		and quicker. When they were of an age to
		learn to read, Leon, who made but little
		progress, and stumbled along with one of
		those alphabets with pictures where the letter
		E is by the side of an elephant and the
		letter Z by the side of a zouave, was the despair
		of his mother. But as soon as Norine,
		who in a very short time learned to spell
		and read, came to the aid of the little man,
		he immediately made rapid progress.</p>

		<p>So things went on, until both children
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>189</span>were sent to a school for little children kept
		by a gentlewoman named Merlin, in the Rue
		de l&#8217;Homme Armé.</p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<img src="images/fig202.jpg" alt="A boy and a girl hold hands and walk to school." />
		</div>

		<p class="continued">According to the fallacious
		circular which Mademoiselle Merlin
		sent to the folks of the quarter, there was a
		garden&#8212;that is to say, four broomsticks in
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>190</span>a sandy court; and it was there, the first
		day during recess, that the innocent Leon
		burst into cries of terror when he saw the
		school-mistress, forced by some accident to
		interrupt her knitting, stick one of her great
		knitting-needles in her capacious head-dress.
		A &#8220;senior,&#8221; who was more familiar with her
		head-dress, explained the phenomenon in
		vain to Leon and Norine, for the boy, none
		the less, preserved in the presence of Mademoiselle
		Merlin an impression of superstitious
		terror.</p>

		<p>She would have paralyzed his infant faculties,
		and have prevented him in the class
		from following the pointer of Mademoiselle
		Merlin, as she sniffled through her sing-song
		lecture before the map of Europe, or the
		table of weights and measures, if Norine
		had not been there to reassure and encourage
		him. She was at once the first scholar
		in the school, and became for slow and lazy
		Leon a sort of sisterly counsellor and affectionate
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>191</span>under-teacher. Towards four o&#8217;clock
		Madame Bayard had the two children, whom
		the nurse had brought back to the store,
		placed near her in the glass office; and Norine,
		opening a copy-book or a book, explained
		to Leon the uncomprehended task
		or made him repeat the lesson that he had
		not understood.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The good God has rewarded us,&#8221; Madame
		Bayard sometimes whispered to her
		husband in the evening. &#8220;That little Norine
		is a treasure, and so good, so industrious!
		Only to-day I listened to her helping
		Leon again. I believe that without her he
		would never have learned the multiplication-table.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I believe you, Mimi,&#8221; responded Bayard.
		&#8220;I have observed it. Things go on marvellously
		well with us, and we will portion her
		and marry her, shall we not, when she comes
		to a suitable age?&#8221;</p>

		<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>192</span>IV.</h3>

		<p>Age comes&#8212;ah, how fast age comes! And
		behold! now in the glass cage of the shop
		there is a slender and beautiful young girl
		sitting at the side of Madame Bayard, who
		already shows some silver threads in her
		black bands. It is Norine now who writes
		in the great ledger with leather corners, while
		her adopted mother plies her needles on
		some embroidery.</p>

		<p>Seven o&#8217;clock! Time that they came
		home, and the shop must be closed against
		the November wind which is twisting and
		turning the flames of the gas-jets.</p>

		<p>Look at them now: Bayard grown stout,
		portly, and covered with trinkets, while Leon,
		who has just entered the first class in pharmacy,
		has actually become a fine-looking
		young fellow.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Good-day, Mimi; good-day, Norine! Let
		us go right in to dinner. I will tell you all
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>193</span>the news while we are eating the soup,&#8221; said
		the druggist.</p>

		<p>They went up to the dining-room, and
		while Madame Bayard, sitting under a barometer
		in the shape of a lyre, served the
		thick soup, Bayard, tucking his napkin in his
		vest and regarding his wife with a knowing
		look, said,</p>

		<p>&#8220;You know it is all right.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Forgets agree?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Exactly; and Leon will espouse Hortense
		in six months, and our daughter-in-law will
		come and live with us. Yes, Norine, you
		have known nothing about it, because one
		does not speak of such things before young
		girls; but for more than a year Leon has
		been in love with Hortense Forget, and has
		been teasing us to arrange the marriage&#8212;not
		such a difficult thing after all, since it
		only required a word. Leon is a good catch.
		The only difficulty was that we wanted to
		keep our son with us. At last it is all arranged,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>194</span>and your foster brother will have the
		wife he wants. I hope you are pleased.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Very much pleased,&#8221; replied Norine.</p>

		<p>Oh, deaf and blind! They never heard the
		voice of Norine when she replied to them&#8212;that
		low, pathetic tone, which is the echo of
		a broken heart. Nor did they see how pale
		she became, and that her head, suddenly
		grown heavy, swayed from side to side as if
		Norine were about to faint. They saw nothing,
		comprehended nothing; and for a long
		time they had seen and comprehended nothing.
		Yet they dearly loved this Norine, who
		was the grace, the charm of the house. They
		dreamed, these good people, of marrying her
		one of these days to their head-clerk, a widower
		of prudent and economical habits, and
		&#8220;all that is necessary to make a woman happy.&#8221;
		Leon loved her, too, with all his heart;
		but as a dear, good sister. Nor did the great
		spoiled boy suspect that Norine loved him,
		and suffered from her love&#8212;aye, to death
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>195</span>itself. No; even that evening, when they had
		unconsciously inflicted upon her the worst
		of torture, they never suspected the truth;
		and they would sleep peacefully, indulging
		in beautiful dreams of the future, at the very
		hour when, shut in her chamber&#8212;the chamber
		separated by such a thin partition from
		that of her adopted parents&#8212;Norine would
		fall upon her bed, fainting with grief, and
		bury her head in her pillow to stifle her
		sobs.</p>



		<h3>V.</h3>

		<p>The ball is finished; and in the empty
		rooms the candles, burned to the very end,
		have broken some of the sconces and the
		fragments lie upon the waxed floors.</p>

		<p>The Bayards have insisted that the wedding
		should be celebrated at their house;
		but by the aid of many flowers (it is midsummer)
		they have given a holiday appearance
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>196</span>to the apartment in the Rue Vieille du
		Temple where they have triumphantly installed
		their daughter-in-law.</p>

		<p>At last it is finished; the young couple
		have retired to their nuptial chamber, where
		Madame Bayard has gone for a moment
		with them. Coming out she found Norine
		still in the little salon, helping the servants
		extinguish the lights. She embraced the
		young girl tenderly, saying,</p>

		<p>&#8220;Go to bed, my child. You must be very
		tired.&#8221; And she added, with a smile, &#8220;Well,
		it will be your turn before long.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And Norine was at last alone in the room,
		now so gloomy, and lighted only by her single
		candle resting on the piano.</p>

		<p>Heavens! how heavy was the odor of the
		flowers, and how her head ached.</p>

		<p>Ah, that horrible day! What torment she
		had endured since the moment when she
		knelt, impressed into service as a lady&#8217;s-maid,
		with pins in her lips, at the feet of
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>197</span>her rival Hortense, and arranged
		her white satin train,
		to the hour when Leon,
		holding his wife by the
		waist, drew her towards her,
		Norine, and the lips of the
		young couple met almost
		upon her very forehead!<img class="figright" src="images/fig210.jpg" alt="A young woman picks flowers." /></p>

		<p>Oh, the odor of the flowers
		is insupportable, and she
		is so giddy and faint.</p>

		<p>She fell upon a sofa, unnerved
		by a frightful headache,
		her head thrown back, clasping her
		forehead with her two hands, but with open
		eyes staring always at the door&#8212;the door
		of that chamber which was shut upon the
		young couple, closed upon the mystery which
		was breaking her heart. A sort of delirium
		overwhelmed her. How the heavy perfume
		of those flowers overpowered her, and how
		a thousand memories assailed her at once.
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>198</span>She was a child again in the saloon at Argenteuil,
		and the kind Parisians came and
		caressed her. She was embraced by the
		dear little boy wearing a white plume in his
		hat. Rapid pictures flashed upon her soul.
		The <i>pension</i> of the Rue de l&#8217;Homme Armé,
		and Mademoiselle Merlin, with her knitting-needle
		stuck in her head-dress, pointed with
		the end of her stick to the table of weights
		and measures. The drug-store on Sundays,
		all dark, the shutters closed, and she playing
		catch with Leon among the barrels and sacks.</p>

		<p>Good God! was she losing her head? She
		could not help humming that waltz, during
		which Leon once held her in his arms. She
		was stifled. Oh, the flowers! She must go
		out, or at least open a window. But she
		could not rise; her strength had deserted
		her. Could she die thus? Two iron fingers
		seemed to be pressing her temples. Oh, the
		roses and the orange-flowers&#8212;those orange-flowers
		above all!</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>199</span>At last she made a great effort. She rose
		upright and pale&#8212;pale as her white robe.
		But suddenly her strength left her, and falling
		first upon her knees, and then with her
		head and shoulders upon the wood floor,
		poor Norine lay stretched at the threshold
		of the bridal chamber, killed by disappointed
		love and by the flowers.</p>

		</div>

		<h3>I.</h3>

		<p>I was at one time employed in a government
		office. Every day from ten o&#8217;clock
		until four I became a voluntary prisoner
		in a depressing office, adorned with yellow
		pasteboard boxes, and filled with the musty
		odor of old papers. There I lunched on
		Italian cheese and apples which I roasted
		at the grate. I read the morning papers,
		even to the advertisements; I rhymed verses,
		and I attended to the affairs of state to the
		extent of drawing at the end of each month
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>204</span>a salary which barely kept me from starving.</p>

		<p>I recall to-day one of my companions in
		captivity at that epoch.</p>

		<p>He was called Achille Meurtrier, and certainly
		his fierce look and tall form seemed
		to warrant that name. He was a great big
		fellow, about forty years old, not too much
		chest or shoulders, but who increased his
		apparent size by wearing felt hats with wide
		brims, ample and short coats, large plaid
		trousers, and neckties of a sanguine red under
		rolling collars. He wore a full beard,
		long hair, and was very proud of his hairy
		hands.</p>

		<p>The chief boast of Meurtrier, otherwise
		the best and most amiable of companions,
		was to trifle with an athletic constitution, to
		possess the biceps of a prize-fighter, and, as
		he said himself, not to know his own strength.
		He never made a gesture, even in the exercise
		of his peaceful profession, that did not
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>205</span>have for its object to convince the spectators
		of his prodigious vigor. Did he have to
		take from its case a half-empty pasteboard
		box, he advanced towards the shelf with the
		heavy step of a street porter, grasped the
		box solidly with a tight hand, and carried it
		with a stiff arm as far as the next table, with
		a shrugging of shoulders and frowning of
		brow worthy of Milo of Crotona. He carried
		this manner so far that he never used
		less apparent effort even to lift the lightest
		objects, and one day when he held in his
		right hand a basket of old papers I saw him
		extend his left arm horizontally as if to make
		a counterpoise to the tremendous weight.</p>

		<p>I ought to say that this robust creature
		inspired me with a profound respect, for I
		was then, even more than to-day, physically
		weak and delicate, and in consequence filled
		with admiration for that energetic physique
		which I lacked.</p>

		<p>The conversations of Meurtrier were not
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>206</span>of a nature to diminish the admiration with
		which he inspired me.</p>

		<p>In the summer, above all, on Monday
		mornings, when we had returned to the office
		after our Sunday holiday, he had an inexhaustible
		fund of stories concerning his adventures
		and feats of strength. After taking
		off his felt-hat, his coat, and his vest, and
		wiping the perspiration from his forehead
		with the sleeve of his shirt, to indicate his
		sanguine and ardent temperament, he would
		thrust his hands deep in the pockets of his
		trousers, and, standing near me in an attitude
		of perpendicular solidity, begin a monologue
		something as follows:</p>

		<p>&#8220;What a Sunday, my boy! Positively no
		fatigue can lay me up. Think of it: yesterday
		was the regatta at Joinville-le-Pont; at
		six o&#8217;clock in the morning the rendezvous at
		Bercy, at The Mariners, for the crew of the
		<i>Marsouin</i>; the sun is up; a glass of white wine
		and we jump into our rowing suits, seize an
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>207</span>oar and give way&#8212;one-two, one-two&#8212;as far
		as Joinville; then overboard for a swim before
		breakfast&#8212;strip to swimming drawers, a
		jump overboard, and look out for squalls.
		After my bath I have the appetite of a tiger.
		Good! I seize the boat by one hand and I
		call out, &#8216;Charpentier, pass me a small ham.&#8217;
		Three motions in one time and I have finished
		it to the bone. &#8216;Charpentier, pass
		me the brandy-flask.&#8217; Three swallows and
		it is empty.&#8221;</p>

		<p><img class="figright" src="images/fig220.jpg" alt="A bearded man stands with his hands in his pockets, feet wide apart." />So the description would continue&#8212;dazzling,
		Homeric.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is the hour for the regatta&#8212;noon&#8212;the
		sun just overhead.
		The boats draw up in line on
		the sparkling river, before a tent
		gaudy with streamers. On the
		bank the mayor with his staff
		of office, gendarmes in yellow
		shoulder-belts, and a swarm of
		summer dresses, open parasols,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>208</span>and straw hats. Bang! the signal-gun is
		fired. The <i>Marsouin</i> shoots ahead of all
		her competitors and easily gains the prize&#8212;and
		no fatigue! We go around Marne,
		and, returning, dine at Créteil. How cool
		the evening in the dusky arbor, where pipes
		glow through the darkness, and moths singe
		their wings in the flame of the <i>omelette au
		kirsch</i>. At the end of a dessert, served on
		decorated plates, we hear from the ball-room
		the call of the cornet&#8212;&#8216;Take places for the
		quadrille!&#8217; But already a rival crew, beaten
		that same morning, has monopolized the
		prettiest girls. A fight!&#8212;teeth broken, eyes
		blackened, ugly falls, and whacks below the
		belt; in a word, a poem of physical enthusiasm,
		of noisy hilarity, of animal spirits,
		without speaking of the return at midnight,
		through crowded stations, with girls whom
		we lift into the cars, friends separated calling
		from one end of the train to the other,
		and fellows playing a horn upon the roof.&#8221;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>209</span>And the evenings of my astonishing companion
		were not less full of adventure than
		his Sundays. Collar-and-elbow wrestling
		in a tent, under the red light of torches, between
		him&#8212;simple amateur&#8212;and Du Bois,
		the iron man, in person; rat-chases near
		the mouths of sewers, with dogs as fierce as
		tigers; sanguinary encounters at night, in
		the most dangerous quarters, with ruffians
		and nose-eaters, were the most insignificant
		episodes of his nightly career. Nor do I
		dare relate other adventures of a more intimate
		character, from which, as the writers
		of an earlier day would say in noble
		style, a pen the least timorous would recoil
		with horror.</p>

		<p>However painful it may be to confess an
		unworthy sentiment, I am obliged to say
		that my admiration for Meurtrier was not
		unmixed with regret and bitterness. Perhaps
		there was mingled with it something
		of envy. But the recitation of his most marvellous
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>210</span>exploits had never awakened in me
		the least feeling of incredulity, and Achille
		Meurtrier easily took his place in my mind
		among heroes and demigods, between Roland
		and Pirithous.</p>



		<h3>II.</h3>

		<p>At this time I was a great wanderer in
		the suburbs, and I occupied the leisure of
		my summer evenings by solitary walks in
		those distant regions, as unknown to the
		Parisians of the boulevards as the country
		of the Caribbees, and of whose sombre
		charm I endeavored later to tell in verse.</p>

		<p>One evening in July, hot and dusty, at the
		hour when the first gas-lights were beginning
		to twinkle in the misty twilight, I was walking
		slowly from Vaugirard through one of
		those long and depressing suburban streets
		lined on each side by houses of unequal
		height, whose porters and porteresses, in
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>211</span>shirt sleeves and in calico, sat on the steps
		and imagined that they were taking the fresh
		air. Hardly any one passing in the whole
		street; perhaps, from end to end, a mason,
		white with plaster, a sergeant-de-ville, a child
		carrying home a four-pound loaf larger than
		himself, or a young girl hurrying on in hat
		and cloak, with a leather bag on her arm;
		and every quarter-hour the half-empty omnibus
		coming back to its place of departure
		with the heavy trot of its tired horses.</p>

		<p>Stumbling now and then on the pavement&#8212;for
		asphalt is an unknown luxury in these
		places&#8212;I went down the street, tasting all
		the delights of a stroller. Sometimes I stopped
		before a vacant lot to watch, through
		the broken boards of the fence, the fading
		glories of the setting sun and the black silhouettes
		of the chimneys thrown against a
		greenish sky. Sometimes, through an open
		window on the ground-floor, I caught sight
		of an interior, picturesque and familiar: here
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>212</span>a jolly-looking laundress holding her flat-iron
		to her cheek; there workmen sitting at tables
		and smoking in the basement of a cabaret,
		while an old Bohemian with long gray
		hair, standing before them, sang something
		about &#8220;Liberty,&#8221; accompanying himself on
		a guitar about the color of bouillon&#8212;the
		scenes of Chardin and Van Ostade.</p>

		<p>Suddenly I stopped.</p>

		<p>One of these personal pictures had caught
		my eye by its domestic and charming simplicity.</p>

		<p>She looked so happy and peaceful in her
		quiet little room, the dear old lady in her
		black gown and widow&#8217;s cap, leaning back
		in an easy-chair covered with green Utrecht
		velvet, and sitting quietly with her hands
		folded on her lap. Everything around her
		was so old and simple, and seemed to have
		been preserved, less through a wise economy
		than on account of hallowed memories, since
		the honey-moon with monsieur of the high
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>213</span>complexion, in a frock-coat and flowered
		waistcoat, whose oval crayon ornamented
		the wall.</p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<img src="images/fig226.jpg" alt="An old woman naps in a chair next to a piano." />
		</div>

		<p class="continued">By two lamps on the mantle-shelf
		every detail of the old-fashioned furniture
		could be distinguished, from the clock on a
		fish of artificial and painted marble to the
		old and antiquated piano, on which, without
		doubt, as a young girl, in leg-of-mutton sleeves
		and with hair dressed <i>à la Grecque</i>, she had
		played the airs of Romagnesi.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>214</span>Certainly a loved and only daughter, remaining
		unmarried through her affection for
		her mother, piously watched over the last
		years of the widow. It was she, I was sure,
		who had so tenderly placed her dear mother;
		she who had put the ottoman under her
		feet, she who had put near her the inlaid table,
		and arranged on it the waiter and two
		cups. I expected already to see her coming
		in carrying the evening coffee&#8212;the sweet,
		calm girl, who should be dressed in mourning
		like the widow, and resemble her very much.</p>

		<p>Absorbed by the contemplation of a scene
		so sympathetic, and by the pleasure of imagining
		that humble poem, I remained standing
		some steps from the open window, sure
		of not being noticed in the dusky street,
		when I saw a door open and there appeared&#8212;oh,
		how far he was from my thoughts at
		that moment&#8212;my friend Meurtrier himself,
		the formidable hero of tilts on the river and
		frays in unknown places.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>215</span>A sudden doubt crossed me. I felt that
		I was on the point of discovering a mystery.</p>

		<p>It was indeed he. His terrible hairy
		hand held a tiny silver coffee-pot, and he
		was followed by a poodle which greatly embarrassed
		his steps&#8212;a valiant and classic
		poodle, the poodle of blind clarionet-players,
		a poor beggar&#8217;s poodle, a poodle clipped like
		a lion, with hairy ruffles on his four paws,
		and a white mustache like a general of the
		Gymnase.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mamma,&#8221; said the giant, in a tone of ineffable
		tenderness, &#8220;here is your coffee. I
		am sure that you will find it nice to-night.
		The water was boiling well, and I poured it
		on drop by drop.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the old lady, rolling
		her easy-chair to the table with an air;
		&#8220;thank you, my little Achille. Your dear
		father said many a time that there was not
		my equal at making coffee&#8212;he was so kind
		and indulgent, the dear, good man&#8212;but I
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>216</span>begin to believe that you are even better
		than I.&#8221;</p>

		<p>At that moment, and while Meurtrier was
		pouring out the coffee with all the delicacy
		of a young girl, the poodle, excited no doubt
		by the uncovered sugar, placed his forepaws
		on the lap of his mistress.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Down, Médor,&#8221; she cried, with a benevolent
		indignation. &#8220;Did any one ever see
		such a troublesome animal? <img class="figleft" src="images/fig229.jpg" alt="A man in an apron pours liquid into a coffee pot." />Look here,
		sir! you know very well that
		your master never fails to give
		you the last of his cup. By-the-way,&#8221;
		added the widow,
		addressing her son, &#8220;you have
		taken the poor fellow out, have
		you not?&#8221;</p>


		<p>&#8220;Certainly, mamma,&#8221; he replied,
		in a tone that was almost infantile.
		&#8220;I have just been to the creamery for your
		morning milk, and I put the leash and collar
		on Médor and took him with me.&#8221;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>217</span>&#8220;And he has attended to all his little
		wants?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be disturbed. He doesn&#8217;t want
		anything.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Reassured on this point, important to canine
		hygiene, the good dame drank her coffee,
		between her son and her dog, who each
		regarded her with an inexpressible tenderness.</p>

		<p>It was assuredly unnecessary to see or
		hear more. I had already descried what a
		peaceful family life&#8212;upright, pure, and devoted&#8212;my
		friend Meurtrier hid under his
		chimerical gasconades. But the spectacle
		with which chance had favored me was at
		once so droll and so touching that I could
		not resist the temptation to watch for some
		moments longer. That indiscretion sufficed
		to show me the whole truth.</p>

		<p>Yes, this type of roisterers, who seemed to
		have stepped from one of the romances of
		Paul de Kock&#8212;this athlete, this despot of
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>218</span>bar-rooms and public-houses&#8212;performed
		simply and courageously, in these lowly
		rooms in the suburbs, the sublime duties of
		a sister of charity. This intrepid oarsman
		had never made a longer voyage than to
		conduct his mother to mass or vespers every
		Sunday. This billiard expert knew only how
		to play bézique. This trainer of bull-dogs
		was the submissive slave of a poodle. This
		Mauvaise-Philibert was an Antigone.</p>

		<h3>III.</h3>

		<p>The next morning, on arriving at the office,
		I asked Meurtrier how he had employed the
		previous evening, and he instantly improvised,
		without a moment&#8217;s hesitation, an account
		of a sharp encounter on the boulevard
		at two in the morning, when he had knocked
		down with a single blow of his fist, having
		passed his thumb through the ring of his
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>219</span>keys, a terrible street rough. I listened,
		smiling ironically, and thinking to confound
		him; but remembering how respectable a
		virtue is which is hidden even under an absurdity,
		I struck him amicably on the shoulder,
		and said, with conviction:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Meurtrier, you are a hero!&#8221;</p>
